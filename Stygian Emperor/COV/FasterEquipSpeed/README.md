Faster COV Equip Speed
----------------------
Created by **Stygian Emperor**

Reduces the time it takes to "rev up" the crude engines of COV weapons (to about 1/4 of unmodded) to make them ready to fire in approximately the same time it takes to switch to most other manufacturers' guns. However, the readying animations remain unchanged, so you *will* see your character's hand move impossibly quickly over the weapons' starters immediately after drawing them.

This mod has not been tested with every single COV weapon, so there may be a legendary or unique which still ready at their unmodded speed. Let me know if anything is amiss.

- **Lions-666** on DeviantArt for recreating the [COV logo in HD](https://www.deviantart.com/lions-666/art/Cov-821199043), which I used for the mod's image.
- **Apocalyptech** for doing a fantastic job with documentation on the modding process and helping out in Discord wherever I had questions.

Changelog
---------
**v1.0.1:** Increased COV guns' equip time from **0.4** to **0.5**. I think that's in seconds, so probably not noticeable, but this seems closer to my target equip time: about the same as most other manufacturers'.
