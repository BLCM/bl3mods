### CHANGELOG
### v1.0.1: Increased COV guns' equip time from 0.4 to 0.5. I think that's in seconds, 
### so probably not noticeable, but this seems closer to my target equip time: about the
### same as most other manufacturers'.
###
### DESCRIPTION
### Reduces the time it takes to "rev up" the crude engines of COV weapons (to about 1/4
### of unmodded) to make them ready to fire in approximately the same time it takes to
### switch to most other manufacturers' guns. However, the readying animations remain
### unchanged, so you will see your character's hand move impossibly quickly over the
### weapons' starters immediately after drawing them.
### 
### This mod has not been tested with every single COV weapon, so there may be a legendary 
### or unique which still ready at their unmodded speed. Let me know if anything is amiss.
