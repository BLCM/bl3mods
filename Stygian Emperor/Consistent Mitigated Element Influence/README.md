Consistent & Mitigated Element Influence on Damage
--------------------------------------------------
This edit was created by **Stygian Emperor** based on the original mod, *No Elemental Penalties*, by **CZ47**. 

By default, this reduces elemental penalties & bonuses vs, health, armor, and shields, but does not remove them entirely. It primarily brings TVHM and Mayhem mode in-line with playthrough 1, but shifts the balance subtly to generally make non-elemental and corrosive damage more useful throughout the game.

I made this setup specifically because I did not enjoy swapping weapons constantly against every single non-boss enemy in higher Mayhem levels, but uploaded it in case anyone else wanted an easy way to mess with these numbers.

Elemental Damage Chart
----------------------
The following is a chart showing the values in this mod (in all playthroughs and Mayhem levels):
|            | FLESH | SHIELD | ARMOR |
|   :---:    |   ---:|    ---:|   ---:|
| NONE       |  110% |   100% |   80% |
| INCENDIARY |  150% |    80% |   75% |
| SHOCK      |   80% |   150% |   75% |
| CORROSIVE  |   80% |    80% |  155% |
| CRYOGENIC  |  100% |    80% |  120% |
| RADIATION  |  100% |   120% |   75% |

However, the .bl3hotfix file can be edited in a text editor such as Notepad++ to easily alter the influence of elemental damage to your own liking.

Changelog
---------
**v1.0.1:** Made non-elemental damage have the same penalty to armor as other elements, but increased its bonus against flesh by 20% to balance it against cryogenic and radiation damage. Increased corrosive's bonus against armor by 5% to (imperceptibly) further push it toward being actually useful.

**v1.0.2:** Remembered enemies's attacks also use these numbers, so partially reverted non-elemental damage's bonus against flesh to 10% (from 20%), and conversely reduced its penalty to armor back down to 20% (from 25%) to compensate.
