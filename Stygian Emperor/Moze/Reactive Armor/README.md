Moze Skill - Reactive Armor
---------------------------
Created by **Stygian Emperor**

Replaces Moze's tier-4 passive skill, *Why Can't I Carry All These Grenades?*, with a skill that is actually useful to her at high levels: *Reactive Armor*, which increases Moze's and Iron Bear's resistance to splash, fire, and radiation damage - including self-damage.

Because **Grimm** helped me so much with the stats scaling, he gets **50%** of all the **store credit** this mod makes.

Reactive Armor Resistance by Rank
---------------------------------
Refer to the following chart for actual resistance numbers, as, due to a current limitation of hotfix-modding, the splash resistance claimed by the skill card varies slightly from the value displayed in-game (except for at rank 3):
|Resistance| Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 |*Rank 4*|*Rank 5*|*Rank 6*|*Rank 7*|*Rank 8*|
| :------: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: |
|  Splash  | 14.3%  | 25.0%  | 33.3%  |*40.0%* |*45.5%* |*50.0%* |*53.8%* |*57.1%* |
|   Fire   |  6.2%  | 11.8%  | 16.7%  |*21.1%* |*25.0%* |*28.6%* |*31.8%* |*34.8%* |
| Radiation|  6.2%  | 11.8%  | 16.7%  |*21.1%* |*25.0%* |*28.6%* |*31.8%* |*34.8%* |

*Ranks above 3 can only be legitimately attained through the* ***Grenadier*** *class mod.*

(From my testing, it seems like the splash and other elemental resistances stack when hit by an elemental splash, though I'm not sure whether that's additively.)

Changelog
---------
**v1.0.1** (7/27/2021)**:** The stats increase more satisfyingly per rank, and the skill card's claim that your splash resistance is only double your fire/rad resistance until rank 3 is more accurate.
