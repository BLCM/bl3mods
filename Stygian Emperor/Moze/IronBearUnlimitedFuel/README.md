Iron Bear - Unlimited Fuel
--------------------------
Makes Iron Bear/Iron Cub use no fuel, so it will only leave if destroyed through damage or if exited by Moze. 

Files (Use only one!)
-----
- **IronBearUnlimitedFuel:** This does not alter action skill cooldown; if Iron Bear leaves for any reason, it will take the normal amount of time to be usable again.

- **IronBearUnlimitedFuel_FullRefund:** If Moze exits Iron Bear early, 100% of Iron Bear's cooldown will be refunded and Iron Bear will be usable again immediately.

To Do
-----
- See if I can unlock Iron Cub's hardpoints while it is active, as otherwise changing them will require Iron Cub to be destroyed or the player to travel to a different zone.

Changelog
