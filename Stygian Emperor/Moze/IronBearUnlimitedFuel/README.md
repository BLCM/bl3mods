Iron Bear - Unlimited Fuel
--------------------------
Makes Iron Bear/Iron Cub use no fuel, so it will only leave if destroyed through damage or if exited by Moze. 
**Note:** This mod does not alter action skill cooldown; if Iron Bear leaves, it will take the normal amount of time to be usable again.

To Do
-----
- See if I can unlock Iron Cub's hardpoints while it is active, as otherwise changing them will require Iron Cub to be destroyed or the player to travel to a different zone.

Changelog
---------
- **v1.0.0 (7/8/21):** Initial release.
