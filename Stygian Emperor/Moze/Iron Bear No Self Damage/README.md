Iron Bear - No Self-Damage
--------------------------
Makes Iron Bear/Iron Cub deal no self-damage, so it can have even a chance to use its splash weapons, especially at higher mayhem levels. I don't know why this isn't how it works by default.

Changelog
---------
- **v1.0.0 (8/4/21):** Initial release.

Credits
---------
- **rafi**, for inspiring me to release this cut-down version of a personal mod I had already made.
