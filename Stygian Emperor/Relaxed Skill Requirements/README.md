Relaxed Skill Requirements
--------------------------
Created by **Stygian Emperor**

Changes the point investment requirement for each tier of any given skill tree. I made this (based on **CZ47**'s **Unrestricted Skilltrees**) in order to let me skip most skills in which I had no interest (LOOKING AT YOU ZANE'S BLUE TREE), but not allow me to reach the capstones any easier to keep my characters somewhat on-level.

Skill Investment Required Per Tier
----------------------------------
The following table shows how many skill points must be invested in a given tree to unlock a skill tier within that tree:
|   Tier  |  Base Game  |  This Mod  |
| ------: | ----------: | ---------: |
|      1  |           0 |          0 |
|      2  |           5 |          0 |
|      3  |          10 |          5 |
|      4  |          15 |         10 |
|      5  |          20 |         15 |
|      6  |          25 |         25 |

However, the .bl3hotfix file can be edited in a text editor such as Notepad++ to easily alter the investment requirements to your own liking ~~(which is basically all I did to make this)~~.
