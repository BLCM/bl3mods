# DISCLAIMER - The numbers listed going from here down may not be 100% accurate in some cases. It may something like "Accuracy increased by 200%" but that doesn't mean it'll have an Accuracy of 200%+. Take the numbers with a grain of salt.


BASIC PLAYER CHANGES

Doubled the base melee damage and base slam damage, while base slide damage has been increased by 260% (on par with the newly buffed base melee damage.) Players now hit harder without affecting certain gear like the Face-puncher or Stinger.


MAYHEM MODE CHANGES

Removed all non-enemy health-based Mayhem mode scaling. No skill scaling, action skill scaling, shield scaling, pet scaling, vehicle scaling, etc.
Guns and grenades no longer receive increased damage from Mayhem levels. The Mayhem level text no longer displays on gear either (but your gear will still be regular Mayhem gear when the mod is no longer active.).
Nerfed enemy health scaling in Mayhem Mode. Enemy health now increases by 100% per Mayhem level, up to 1000% at Mayhem 10.
The "[Turn It Up To] Mayhem 11" modifier is now called "[None] Nay-hem". It can show up in Easy, Medium, Hard, and Very Hard.
Reduced the probability of finding green-rarity gear starting from Mayhem 6 and decreasing as the Mayhem Level is increased up to Mayhem 8.


LOOT POOL CHANGES
-----------------
The cost for re-rolling anointments on gear has been reduced to 50 eridium.

Removed Uncommon gear from Earl's Veteran Rewards Machine, made quest reward items more common, made the item of the day a Legendary gun or shield, increased amount of items in the vendor to 20.

Replaced the Butcher and Lucian's Call in Loot-o-Gram redemption with a random drop from the slaughter boss loot pools.

Added a 33% chance for Anointed Zealots to drop Alien-Barrel Submachine Guns.

Added a 33% chance for Anointed Tinks to drop Alien-Barrel Pistols.

Added a 33% chance for Anointed Psychos to drop Alien-Barrel Shotguns.

Added a 33% chance for Anointed Enforcers to drop Alien-Barrel Assault Rifles.

Added a 33% chance for Anointed Goons to drop Alien-Barrel Sniper Rifles.

Added a 33% chance for Anointed Goliaths to drop Alien-Barrel Heavy Weapons.

 ┗----Rationale: Given how Anointed enemies are practically mini-bosses in their own right, an extra reward in the form of a blue or purple alien-barrel gun seems fair. These drops can also occur from any of the named Anointed enemies excluding the Anointed Alpha.

Added a 50% chance for General Traunt to drop a purple Atlas grenade separately from his regular loot pool.

Added a 75% chance for Blinding Banshee to drop a purple Hyperion grenade separately from their regular loot pool.

Added a 75% chance for Lt. Preston to drop a purple Pangolin grenade separately from his regular loot pool.

Added a 75% chance for Crushjaw to drop a purple Tediore grenade separately from her regular loot pool.

Added a 75% chance for Lagromar to drop a purple Torgue grenade separately from his regular loot pool.

Added a 75% chance for Tink-Train to drop a purple Vladof grenade separately from her regular loot pool.

 ┗----Rationale: With guns and shields, you're at least able to farm them to some degree through either Earl's Veteran Rewards Machine or the Eridian Fabricator, but that isn't the case for grenades. With certain purple grenades being highly desirable and having no suitable Legendary alternative, late-game drop sources have been added for each manufacturer's purple grenades to provide an option to obtain them. Atlas grenades are only a 50% chance since there's less part variety due to lacking elements.

Increased the odds of a Sickle spawning as a Boom Sickle to 40%.

Increased Raging Titan's chance of dropping from his loot pool to 80% and increase the number of drops from this pool to 2.

Increased Tremendous Rex's number of drops from its loot pool to 2.

Increased Red Rain's chance of dropping from its loot pool to 100% and increase the number of drops from this pool to 2.

Increased Blue Fire's chance of dropping from its loot pool to 100% and increase the number of drops from this pool to 2.

Increased the odds of Agonizer 9000 dropping from its loot pools to 30% for the White Elephant/Dictator, 40% for the Damned/Loaded Dice/EMP-5/Backburner pool, give it two chances to drop from the loot pools each, and reduce the odds of the Agonizer 1500 considerably.

Increased drop rates from Black, Yellow, and Red Power Troopers to 13.33%.

Increased drops rates from Pink and Blue Power Troopers to 20%.

Increased the number of Bloody Harvest Legendary drops from Captain Haunt.

Increased the chance of GenIVIV dropping from her loot pool to 30%.

Increased the chance of finding Arms-Race exclusive Legendary gear in the Arms Race chests that are locked behind fights.

Added the Bekah to Tyreen's Loot Pool, increased the chance of Tyreen dropping from her loot pool to 40%.

Added the Earworm to Graveward's Loot Pool, increased the chance of Graveward dropping from its loot pool to 40%.

Added the Hunt(er) to Manvark's Loot Pool, increased the chance of Manvark dropping from his loot pool to 40%.

Added the Cloud Kill to Rampager's Loot Pool, switch the Duc with the Quadomizer in Rampager's loot pool and Added the Duc to Dreg and Rage, increased the chance of the Rampager dropping from its loot pool to 50%.

Added the Hand of Glory to Muldock's Loot Pool, increased the chance of Muldock dropping from his loot pool to 30%.

Added the Null-Pointer and Vault Hero to Gigamind, increased the chance of Gigamind dropping from its loot pool to 40%.

Added the Vibra-Pulse to Atomic and Sylestro's Loot Pool, increased the chance of them dropping from their loot pool to 30%.

Added the Boo to Private Beans' Trevanator/Front Loader Loot Pool (Westergun uses a separate pool), increased the chance of Beans dropping from the Trevanator/Front Loader loot pool to 30%.

Added the Ember's Purge to Loco Chantelle, increased chance of Loco Chantelle dropping from her loot pool to 20%.

Added the Scoville to Freddie, increased chance of Freddie dropping from his loot pool to 20%.

Added the Rico to Jack-bot, increasedd weight for DLC1 class mods to drop, increased chance of Jack-bot dropping from its pool to 70%.

Added Digby's Smooth Tube to Junpei Goat Eater, increased chance of Junpei dropping from his loot pool to 20%.

Added the Robo-Melter Masher to Tricksy Nick with a 10% chance of dropping.

Added the Melt-Facer to Fabricator with a 15% chance to drop. Drops separately from ION CANNON.

Added the Just Kaus to EVIL Saint Lawrence, increased chance of Lawrence dropping from his loot pool to 20%.

Added the All-In to Golden Bullion with a 10% chance to drop.

Added the Acid Burn to DEGEN-3, increased chance of DEGEN-3 dropping from its loot pool to 20%.

Added La Varlope to Rudy Varlope with a 10% chance to drop, fixed his name not showing up properly in Playthrough 2.

Added Ember's Blaze to Stanley with a 10% chance of dropping.

Added the Double Downer to Gorgeous Armada, increased chance of Armada dropping from his loot pool to 20%.

Added the All-In to Golden Bullion with a 10% chance to drop.

Added the Short Stick to Yeti, increased chance of Yeti dropping from its loot pool to 50%.

Added the Pearl of Knowledge, Firecracker, and non-Legendary Love Drill to Eleanor, increased chance of Eleanor dropping from her loot pool to 40%.

Added the Seventh Sense to Wendigo, increased chance of Wendigo dropping from his loot pool to 30%.

Added the Initiative to Amach, increased chance of Amach dropping from his loot pool to 50%.

Added The Cure to Kritchy, increased chance of Kritchy dropping from its loot pool to 50%.

Added the Cocky Bastard to Gmork, increased chance of Gmork dropping from his loot pool to 50%.

Added the Skullmasher to Kukuwajack, increased chance of Kukuwajack dropping from its loot pool to 30%.

Added the Sacrificial Lamb to Eista as a guaranteed drop, make Eista have a 30% chance to drop a DLC2 item of each type, and fattened up his drops with more money, eridium, and more chances for Legendary gear.

Added an additional 35% chance to drop from each of the Underboss drop pools and a 10% chance to drop the Pricker to Joey Ultraviolet.

Added the Quickdraw to Ipswitch Dunne, increased chance of Ipswitch Dunne dropping from his loot pool to 40%.

Added the Chalice to Lani Dixon, increased chance of Lani Dixon dropping from her loot pool to 40%.

Added the Bubble Blaster to Haddon Marr, increased chance of Haddon Marr dropping from his loot pool to 40%.

Added the Peashooter to Adelai Bronson, increased chance of Adelai dropping from her loot pool to 40%.

Added Doc Hina's Miracle Bomb to Doc Stanley with a 10% chance to drop.

Added the Beast to Lectrikor, increased chance of Lectrikor dropping from its loot pool to 40%.

Added the Icebreaker to Lasodactyl, increased chance of Lasodactyl dropping from its loot pool to 40%.

Added the Vendetta to Kormash.

Added the Core Buster to Bellik Primus, increased chance of Bellik Primus dropping from its loot pool to 50%.

Added the Splinter to the Quartermaster.

Added the Dakota to the Ruiner.

Added the Ashen Beast, Minor Kong, P.A.T. Mk. II, and Sawpenny to the Psycho Krieg DLC unique item world drop pool, and made the pool drop twice whenever it drops.

Added more chances to drop Arms Race Legendary Gear from the Heavyweight Harker

Added the Company Man to the Gravekeeper, increased chance of Gravekeeper dropping from its loot pool to 30%.

 ┗----Rationale: The reason the Company Man has been added to the Gravekeeper is purely a quality-of-life change for allegiance playthroughs so that said playthroughs don't have to wait until Hemovorous to get a Company Man. Hemovorous will still be a far more reliable farm for Company Men, however.

Added a small chance of dropping a Mysterious Amulet from the Seer and made the Seer drop two items from its unique pool whenever it would drop one instead.

Increased the amount of chances for Anathema to drop its loot, one guaranteed piece of Mayhem 6 gear, and a significant amount of money, eridium, and blue or higher gear.

Increased the amount of chances for Scourge to drop his loot, multiple chances for pieces of Mayhem 6 gear, and a metric crapton of money, eridium, and blue or higher gear.

Increased the amount of chances for Hemovorous to drop her loot, three guaranteed Company Men, and a significant amount of money, eridium, and blue or higher gear.

Added three guaranteed Mayhem 6 drops to Vermivorous, a 50% chance to drop a random Director's Cut item, and more loot in general.


ENEMY CHANGES
-------------
Eista now retains "the Invincible" in his name for rematches after "We Slass! Part 3". Eista the Invincible's total health has been buffed, now roughly halfway between Wotan and Scourge.

Joey Ultraviolet's total health has been reduced to roughly half of what it was previously.

Anathema the Relentless now only triggers an immune phase at 50% and 0% of a health bar instead of every quarter of a health bar. 5 immunity phases total.

 ┗----Rationale: Scourge the Invincible also has a lot of immunity phases, but there is variety to said immunity phases. Anathema's immunity phases are largely monotonous, so reducing the amount of these phases improves the flow of the fight.

Tweaked the Badass enemy spawn rates in the Slaughter Shaft. Badass Zealots and Tinks are now less common while Badass Enforcers, Goliaths, Goons, and Psychos are more common.

 ┗----Rationale: The Badass and Armored Badass Zealots/Tinks are each their own type that can spawn (so four different badasses). Coupled with the fact that Zealots and Tinks are the most common enemy types you face in the COV forces, the Slaughter Shaft largely turned into a gauntlet of heavy weapon spam and tink turrets with the occasional blip from a different Badass type or Anointed enemy. Hence the reduction in Badass Zealot/Tink spawn rates and increase in other Badass spawn rates.

Enemies no longer spawn with cryo-element guns for the most part.

 ┗----Rationale: For enemies that are clearly cryo such as certain beasts or Heavies, being able to slow the player down isn't an issue as the player is able to easily determine that they should stay back if they want to avoid being slowed. That isn't viable for common gun-wielding enemies. Getting lightly tickled by a single bullet from some cannon fodder and suddenly becoming unable to dodge a hail of punishment is very irritating, and it is too difficult to try to determine if every single gun-wielding is using a cryo weapon or not by looking at the elemental glow on their weapon.

Anointed Enforcers should no longer spawn outside of the encounters with the Anointed Alpha, Luke, and Muldock.
 ┗----Rationale: If 2/3 of the moves this enemy could make didn't make them immune to damage (as well as not being able to switch between the immunity actions repeatedly), this enemy would be stomachable. But one can potentially waste minutes waiting for this enemy to actually be vulnerable. Removing this enemy improves the flow of combat.
 

OTHER CHANGES/FIXES
-------------------
Typhon, Claptrap, Ava, Lilith, Maya, Lorelei, Clay, Hammerlock (DLC2), and Gaige have had their overall movement speed increased to be 50% higher than a standard Vault Hunter's and their sprint speed has been increased to 75%.

Applied a band-aid fix to Vendor Crashing by adjusting how the Item of the Day appears on the outside of the vendor.

Fixed the Digi-Clone's Dahl pistol appearing in Maurice's 30th week Black Market vendor. Said week now spawns with a Nova Berner instead alongside the usual Hellwalker and Firestorm.

Changed the way ammo drops occur so that they should now drop more ammo for what you actually need.

Fixed Beef Plisken yeeting his loot into the abyss.

Fixed the Slaughterstar bosses dropping their loot into the abyss.

Fixed Guns, Love, and Tentacles/Fantastic Fustercluck enemies not dropping shields.

Fixed Siren COMs sometimes spawning with a blank part.

############
GEAR CHANGES

Damage on almost all Legendary and Unique gear has been adjusted to a less spongey environment (things that performed well in the usual Mayhem 10 will almost assuredly have the damage numbers lowered, but not necessarily be less effective). Nearly every Legendary piece of gear should be at minimum viable. Weapon changes listed below are basically anything that wasn't a damage change (anything that says "No change" most likely means it only had a damage change.)


GUNS

Atlas
-----
Increased Assault Rifle Damage by 20%.

Removed Heavy Weapon Movement Speed Penalty.

 ┗----Rationale: It makes little sense for only some heavy weapons to have a movement speed penalty while others do not. Moving slower also just sucks. The same change has been made for Vladof weapons.

COV
-----
No changes.

Dahl
-----
Increased Damage of Semi-Auto Firing Mode by 20% and improved Accuracy Spread by 50% for Pistols and SMGs.

Increased SMG Fire Rate and Magazine Size by 40% each.

 ┗----Rationale: SMGs were a bit lacking in DPS compared to other weapon types when I crunched the numbers, so I buffed the mag size and fire rate to make better use of that stupidly high ammo pool. Same goes for Hyperion and Maliwan SMGs.
 
Hyperion
-----
Increased SMG Fire Rate and Magazine Size by 40% each, and Damage by 12%.

Increased Sniper Rifle Damage by 38%. 

Jakobs
-----
Assault Rifle Masher Trigger - Improved Spread by 30%, reduced Recoil Height by 15%, improved Weapon Sway by 25%, removed Fire Rate penalty, and increased Magazine Size by 50%.

 ┗----Rationale: The AR masher trigger was inferior to the pistol masher grip in most stats, so it has been made roughly equal to it. As for the ammo cost not being lowered, an increase in magazine size should be sufficient instead.
 
Maliwan
-----
Increased SMG Fire Rate and Magazine Size by 40% each, and Damage by 18%.

Tediore
-----
No changes.

Torgue
-----
Increased Pistol Damage by 12.5%, Fire Rate by 20%, and improved Reload Speed by 15%.

Increased Assault Rifle Damage by 40%, Fire Rate and Projectile Speed by 20%, and decreased Recoil Width by 15% as well as making them fully automatic.

Increased Shotgun Fire Rate by 25%.

Increased Heavy Weapon Magazine Size by one and made them fully automatic.

 ┗----Rationale: Torgue heavy weapons were pretty solid before, but low-magazine versions required loading an awful lot. One more shot per magazine should remedy that to a degree.
 
Vladof
-----
Decreased Assault Rifle Vertical Recoil by 25%.

Increased Sniper Rifle Damage by 10%, Magazine Size by 30%, and improved Reload Speed by 20%.

Increased Heavy Weapon Damage by 17%.

Removed Heavy Weapon Movement Speed Penalty.

Improved the Ammo Regen and Ammo Regen Delay of Pistol Zip-Rocket and Taser Underbarrels.

Improved the Ammo Regen and Ammo Regen Delay of Assault Rifle Grenade Launcher and Shotgun Underbarrels.

Improved the Ammo Regen and Ammo Regen Delay of Sniper Rifle Rocket Launcher and Shotgun Underbarrels.

Improved the Ammo Regen and Ammo Regen Delay of Heavy Weapon Big Boy Underbarrel.

 ┗----Rationale: Underbarrels are one of the main features of Vladof weaponry, but they weren't very useable due to being stingy with the ammo consumption/regeneration balance. They should now be useable on a more regular basis.
 
ATLAS;

Legendary
---------
Carrier - No change.

OPQ - No change.

Portals and Shite - 20% critical damage added.

Rebel Yell - Fire rate lowered by 20%.

Replay - Fire rate reduced by 30%, damage radius increased by 140%.

 ┗----Rationale: While the fire rate is lower, the damage was also adjusted accordingly. It'll be more effective with the ammo you chew through with the post-tracker fire rate boost now.

Linc - No change.

Multi-Tap - Reload speed increased by 190%.

 ┗----Rationale: The cryo rocket launched upon reloading is supposed to be the special feature of this gun, but reloading all the time interferes with the flow of combat. Making the reload lightning-quick resolves that.

Res - No change.

Freeman - No change.

Plumage - Accuracy reduced by 50%, ammo cost set to 2.

 ┗----Rationale: The Plumage's identity was basically "Ruby's Wrath but better." It has been altered to "Ruby's Wrath but bigger" so it isn't just a direct upgrade.

Ruby's Wrath - No change.

Uniques
---------
Peacemonger - Ammo cost set to 3.

Regular
---------
Pattern [NULL] - Increased Damage by 20%, Magazine Size by 1, and Explosion Radius by 30%.

Pattern Black (multi-rocket) - No change.

Pattern Red (mortar launcher) - No change.

Q-System (double projectile) - Adjusted Damage to (roughly) match the pre-Atlas-AR damage buff.

V-System - Added 20% increased Critical Hit Damage.

N-System (high fire rate) - No change.

AX-7 (automatic burst-fire) - No change.

AX-19 - No change.

AX-88 - Reduced ammo cost to one and increased Projectile Speed by 57%.


COV;

Legendary
---------
Embrace the Pain - Accuracy improved, fire rate increased by 70%, heat rate reduced by 20%.

NoPewPew - Ammo cost set to 3.

 ┗----Rationale: Instead of gutting the power of this weapon, so it's been given the ION CANNON treatment and increased the ammo cost. It'll also make x4 and x5 versions not so blatantly inferior to x3 versions.

Pain is Power - Heat rate reduced by 40%.

Rebound - No change.

Sawbar - Made the projectile split happen earlier.

Seeryul Killer - Kill effect stack bonus set to 16.6% per stack.

Stauros' Burn - Self-ignite chance set to 100%.

 ┗----Rationale: If you're going to use this gun, you're using it for the special effect. The chance is now guaranteed for that purpose.

Zheitsev's Eruption - Set maximum reload-debuff to 100%, repair speed improved by 32.5%, fire rate increased by 25%.

 ┗----Rationale: Spend less time using this weapon as a debuff tool and more as an actual weapon.

Gargoyle - Glob damage set to 150%, glob chance set to 33%.

 ┗----Rationale: The glob changes were made as a way to counteract spamming the blobs after the gun breaks.

Hydrafrost - Amp damage set to 50%.

Killing Word - Accuracy improved by 20%.

Linoge - Heat rate improved by 65%, accuracy improved 100%.

 ┗----Rationale: What good is a swarm of bullets if 90% of them miss and you spend half of your time reloading?

Pestilence - 70% radiation damage resistance added.

 ┗----Rationale: The reload-nova is powerful but it also leads to the player falling into FFYL often. The radiation resistance means the nova is useable without being forced into wearing a Red Suit.

Psycho Stabber - Melee damage bonus reduced to 200%, projectiles now actually deal melee damage, melee damage bonus no longer factors in gear or skill bonuses.

 ┗----Rationale: We have an actual example of a knife-firing gun that deals melee damage with said knives in the game (Blade Fury.) It makes sense to allow the original knife-lobber to deal melee damage from the launched knives as well.

Skeksil - Bonus projectile damage set to match card damage.

Tizzy - Reload speed increased by 25%.

Globetrottr - No change.

Major Kong - No change.

Mechanic - No change.

Yellowcake - No change.

Unique
---------
Brad Luck - No change.

Sawpenny - No change.

The Beast - No change.

Hangin' Chadd - No change.

The Killing Word - No change.

Agonizer 1500 - Repair speed increased by 50%, magazine size increased by 2 rounds, heat-per-shot reduced by 66%.

 ┗----Rationale: 80% of your combat time consisting of slowly reloading a weapon usually does not make for an enjoyable experience. More magazine size and faster repairs alleviate this.

Hot Drop - No change.

Minor Kong - No change.

Porta-Pooper 5000 - No change.

Regular
---------
Chucka (spews stuff out, hits five times per second, low range) - No change.

Zooka (mortar launcher, extra melee damage) - No change.

Shredda (sawblade launcher, deals twice the damage on the card for some reason) - No change.

Bombbanayshun (basically a worse Zooka) - Projectile count increased by 3, accuracy reduced by 100%, splash radius reduced by 50%, and ammo cost increased by 1.

 ┗----Rationale: Before these changes, it really was basically just a worse Zooka. The changes that have been made give it more of an identity to distinguish itself from other COV heavy weapons.
 
Holey-Man (high fire rate, has to build up) - No change.

Preecher (extra melee damage) - No change.

Splainer (higher damage, lower fire rate) - No change.

Blastphemy (impacts for 10% of damage, then explodes for card damage) - Increased damage by 150% and projectile speed by 50%.

Ratatater (high fire rate, has to build up, extra melee) - No change.

BizZurker (high heat tolerance) - No change.

Purferator (high damage, lower fire rate) - No change.

Wizzperer (double the card damage, builds up to triple the initial damage) - No change.


DAHL;

Legendary
---------
Barrage - Burst-count set to 7.

Breath of the Dying - Set on-kill projectile damage to 10 times card damage, removed splash damage, doubled the flight speed of on-kill projectiles.

Corruption - Now deals corrosive damage instead of kinetic, reduced Corruption bonus to 20% per stack, increased projectiles produced to 3, reduced initial projectile speed by 50%, made projectiles now accelerate over 3 seconds to ten times the initial speed, fixed projectiles not being boosted by assault rifle damage.

 ┗----Rationale: The Corruption on-kill projectiles were slower than a one-legged skag trying to crawl up a hill. Now the projectiles start out extra slow but quickly acclerate towards their target. As for making it deal corrosive damage, the on-kill projectiles would produce corrosive damage-over-time on struck enemies. Thus it makes sense for the gun itself to deal corrosive damage.

Good Juju - Set critical hit stack bonus to 8%.

Kaos - Set "radsplosion" damage to 5 times card damage.

Star Helix - Ammo cost set to 2, 14 rounds added to magazine.

 ┗----Rationale: Rather than making each bullet do a pittance of damage, it has been given an increase in ammo cost.

Soulrender - Set the amount of skulls spawned from 2 to 1 (this was apparently a thing), increased skull spawn chance to 33%, set skull damage to match card damage.

Warlord - Set ammo saving chance to 66%.

AAA - No change.

Hornet - No change.

Nemesis - No change.

Night Flyer - No change.

The Blanc - Set damage per stack to 7%.

9-Volt - No change.

Blood-Starved Beast - Set explosion chance to 15%, set explosion damage to 1.5 times card damage, fixed it to get SMG boosts instead of AR boosts.

Boomer - No change.

Crader's EMP-5 - No change.

Hellfire - Set damage-over-time chance to be 666%, set damage-over-time to 2.5 times higher than average Dahl SMG DoT damage.

 ┗----Rationale: This weapon's schtick is based on damage-over-time, so we need to make the DoT worthwhile. 100% chance would be enough to guarantee a DoT on most enemies, the 666% chance is just for flavor.

Kaoson - Accuracy and critical penalties removed.

Night Hawkin - No change.

Ripper - Set post-melee gun damage bonus to 100%, increased melee damage to 150%, melee damage bonus no longer factors in gear or skill bonuses.

 ┗----Rationale: This gun encourages a hack n' blast playstyle, so it has been altered to better suit such a style.

Sleeping Giant - Reload-damage bonus set to 50%, omni-boost chance set to 15%.

 ┗----Rationale: Instead of spending excessive amounts of time trying to get the perfect roll of boosts, the gun has been adjusted so it is good even without the omni-boost.

Torrent - Fire rate and mag size adjusted to counteract Dahl SMG buffs.

Vanquisher - Set sliding bonuses to 50% each.

Autoaime - No change.

Sand Hawk - No change.

Stalker - No change.

Malak's Bane - Shotgun-mode ammo cost set to 2, standard mode fire rate increased by 75%.


Unique
---------
Digby's Smooth Tube - No change.

Earworm - No change.

Hail - Critical hit damage set to 100%, set lifesteal to 0.5%.

 ┗----Rationale: This is one of the few weapons that was deliberately nerfed. You shouldn't be able to get a top tier weapon as easily as you can get this. Same goes for the Crit.

Kaleidoscope - Amp damage set to 65%, amp chance set to 100%.

Omniloader - No change.

Ashen Beast - No change.

Brashi's Dedication - No change.

Kenulox - No change.

Regular
---------
Raptor (high fire rate, lower damage) - No change.

Shrike - Increased Damage and Fire Rate by 18%.

Falcon (high damage, extra crit, lower fire rate) - No change.

Wyvern (impacts for 10% of damage, then explodes for card damage) - Increased Damage by 125% and Magazine Size by 40%.

Puma (high fire rate, lower damage) - No change.

Jaguar - Increased Fire Rate by 18%.

Caracal (high damage, lower fire rate) - No change.

Mngwa - (double the card damage, builds up to triple the initial damage) - No change.

Jackal (high fire rate, lower damage, extra melee) - No change.

Hyena - No change.

Wolfhound (high damage, lower fire rate) - No change.

Cadejo (Shots penetrate targets) - Increased Damage by 133% and Magazine Size by 20%.

Rattler (high fire rate, lower damage) - No change.

Asp - Increased Fire Rate by 35%.

Diamondback (high damage, lower fire rate) - No change.

Wyrm (shots ricochet three times and penetrate) - Increased Damage by 150%, reduced Fire Rate by 35%.


HYPERION;

Legendary
---------
Brainstormer - No change.

Conference Call - Increased base projectile count by 2.

Convergence - No change.

Face-puncher - No change.

 ┗----Rationale: The damage on this has been specifically adjusted to not be superior to standard melee for overall damage. It is to be used primarily for when you can't reach out and melee something with fisticuffs.

Fearmonger - No change.

Guardian 4N631 - Set maximum distance bonus to 75%, increased projectile speed by 75%, made description more accurate.

 ┗----Rationale: While it can still be used as a stat-stick to boost the damage on other means of offense, it has been adjusted so that it is now actually viable as a weapon.

Heart Breaker - Set lifesteal to 1.5%, added 25% critical hit damage bonus.

Iceburger - No change.

Phebert - No change.

Reflux - Increased ammo cost by one, projectile count by one, and magazine size by 40%.

 ┗----Rationale: The Reflux was basically Brainstormer 2.0. Rather than ruining the damage, the ammo cost was increased to make it worth considering the Brainstormer over the Reflux at times.

Slow Hand - Set lifesteal to 1.75%.

The Butcher - No change.

Bitch - No change.

Cheap Tips - Set chip-drop chance to 15%, damage boost set to 10%.

Crossroad - Projectile count and accuracy nerfs reverted.

Gold Rush - No change.

Handsome Jackhammer - No change.

Hyperfocus XZ41 - No change.

Oldridian - Reload speed improved by 40%.

 ┗----Rationale: A boost to reload speed now means you can switch to a preferable element more readily.

Predatory Lending - No change.

Proprietary License - No change.

Redistributor - No change.

Smog - Set amp damage to 100%.

Troubleshooter - No change.

Crossbow - No change.

Narp - Post-reload bonuses set to 5%.

Tankman's Shield - Set critical hit damage bonus to 100%.

Woodblocker - Critical hit damage bonus set to 50%, vertical recoil improved by 85%.

Unique
---------
Firecracker - Firework radius set to 500.

Melt Facer - No change.

Reunion - No change.

Just Kaus - No change.

Redistributor - No change.

LOV3M4CH1N3 - No change.

Pricker - No change.

Short Stick - No change.

Null Pointer - No change.

The Two Time - No change.

Regular
---------
Boardroom (higher fire rate, lower damage, extra melee damage) - No change.

Powerplay A (extra crit) - Reduced Damage by 5% and increased Fire Rate by 10%.

Powerplay B (higher damage, lower fire rate) - No change.

Hivemind (ricochets once) - Increased Damage by 100% and Magazine Size by 20%.

Outsourcer (more damage per pellet, less pellets) - Increased Critical Damage by 10%.

Collaborator (high fire rate) - Increased Projectile count slightly.

Downsizer (less damage per pellet, more pellets, extra melee damage) - No change.

Host (exploding globs that bounce three times) - No change.

Techspert (higher fire rate, lower damage, less crit) - No change.

Entrepreneur (increased melee damage) - Reduced Damage by 13% and increased Fire Rate by 10%.

Mogul (higher damage, lower fire rate) - No change.

Broodmother (ricochets twice) - Increased Damage by 105%, reduced Fire Rate by 35%, reduced Magazine Size by 3.


JAKOBS;

Legendary
---------
Bekah - No change.

Blade Fury - Melee portion of the damage reduced to 17.5% of card damage, melee damage bonus no longer factors in gear or skill bonuses.

 ┗----Rationale: The damage on this has been specifically adjusted to not be superior to standard melee for overall damage. It is to be used primarily for when you can't reach out and melee something with fisticuffs.

Clairovoyance - No change.

Gatling Gun - Recoil-per-shot improved by 24%, accuracy improved by 33%, vertical recoil improved by 52.5%, horizontal recoil improved by 15%.

Hand of Glory - No change.

Lead Sprinkler - Splash radius set to 120, lowered speed of bonus projectiles by roughly 19%, improved accuracy by 50%, improved vertical recoil by 25%, improved horizontal recoil by 30%, improved recoil-per-shot by 20%.

 ┗----Rationale: The child projectiles have been adjusted so that they can hit smaller targets.

Mutant - Improved overall recoil control by 35%, now deals radiation damage instead of kinetic.

Rowan's Call - No change.

Stonethrower - No change.

Amazing Grace - 30% critical hit damage added.

Bite Size - No change.

Bloom - Recoil improved by 35%.

King's/Queen's Call - Lifesteal set to 0.25%.

Maggie - No change.

Little Yeeti - Adjusted it so that a masher grip will now increase projectile count to 10 instead of 6.

 ┗----Rationale: This change was made so that the masher variant wasn't blatantly worse than the standard version.

Love Drill - Set Shock chance to 50%, set shock damage to 50%, set innate critical hit damage bonus to 100%.

Lucky 7 - Reload mod chance set to 33% (how often each of them will roll and show up), set "7" roll chance to 20%, "7" damage reduced by 65%, reload speed increased by 66%.

 ┗----Rationale: The Lucky 7 has been adjusted so that you can actually use it effectively as a normal gun instead of spending a copious amount of time trying to get a good roll. If you still insist on fishing for a good roll though, you can do it faster.

Seventh Sense - No change.

The Companion - Status effect damage doubled, removed accuracy penalty.

The Duc - No change.

The Flood - No change.

Trickshot - Added 40% critical hit damage.

Unforgiven - Set innate critical hit damage bonus to 250%, reduced sway while zoomed-in by 85%. "Scopeless" sight now transforms the Unforgiven into a masher with an ammo cost of 2 and now spawns less frequently.

 ┗----Rationale: Changing the scopeless part to behave like a masher is partially to make the scopeless version worth considering over a scoped version, as well as to add a bit of spice to the weapon beyond being a stat stick for critical hit damage. 

Wagon Wheel - No change.

Hellwalker - No change.

Nimble Jack - Added 30% critical hit damage.

One-Pump Chump - Added 50% critical hit damage.

Robin's Call - No change.

Sledge's Shotgun - Sledge's Super Shotgun now also behaves like the triple barrel accessory; higher ammo cost, projectile count, and worse accuracy.

 ┗----Rationale: The "Super" implies a significant increase or change over the standard version. Increasing the burst-fire count by one doesn't amount to much of a difference (especially since the delay between being able to fire again is increased). So now this special triple-barrel accessory actually behaves more like one.

TK's Wave - Improved the accuracy considerably. Reduced damage of Heatwave and Shockwave by 20%.

 ┗----Rationale: The 20% damage reduction to the elemental Waves is simply to be consistent with how elemental parts reduce damage on most other weapons.

The Garcia - No change.

The Tidal Wave - Improved accuracy slightly, doubled projectile speed, set ammo cost to 3.

 ┗----Rationale: The reason for ammo cost being increased is because this thing now hits like a truck if you manage to land all the projectiles.

Bird of Prey - Set bonus projectile damage to match card damage.

Cocky Bastard - Set bonus shock damage to 50%.

Headsplosion - Removed critical hit damage penalty, increased splash radius by 50%.

Ionic Disruptor - Set post-melee damage bonus to 66%.

Monocle - No change.

Skullmasher - Made accuracy spread wider by 100%.

 ┗----Rationale: This love child between a shotgun and a sniper was leaning more towards the sniper side. The accuracy penalty leads to still being useful at mid-long range but it won't be driving nails like a typical sniper rifle now.

Unseen Threat - Set ricochet damage to 33% of card damage.

Wedding Invitation - Set ricochet damage to 2 times card damage.

Unique
---------
Icebreaker - No change.

Pa's Rifle - No change.

The Chalice - Post-crit-kill bonus set to 40%.

Traitor's Death - Incendiary damage set to 50%, incendiary chance set to 50%.

Buttplug - No change.

Dead Chamber - No change.

Love Drill (purple) - Set critical hit damage to 100%.

Peashooter - No change.

Quickdraw - Amp damage set to 50%, amp duration set to 4 seconds.

Robo-Melter - No change.

Rogue-Sight - No change.

Seventh Sense - No change.

Dakota - Incendiary damage set to +50%, shock damage set to +100%, elemental shot chance set to 50%.

Fingerbiter - No change.

Splinter - Removed the "1 ricochet" text.

The Cure - Lifesteal set to 1.5%.

The Shoddy - No change.

The Hunt(ed) - Robot damage bonus set to 50%, added 50% critical hit damage.

The Hunt(er) - Creature damage bonus set to 50%, added 50% critical hit damage.

The Hunt(ress) - Humanoid damage bonus set to 50%, added 50% critical hit damage.

 ┗----Rationale: The Hunt rifles have been adjusted to be similar to the Buffalo or Elephant Gun of older titles; high damage but no scope.

The Ice Queen - No change.

Regular
---------
Marshal (more fire rate, less damage) - Increased Damage by 15% and Handling by 40%.

 ┗----Rationale: More fire rate is typically good on a weapon until you realize it is a semi-automatic weapon. So this one has been given the niche of handling well.

Peacekeeper - Improved Reload Speed by 20% and Magazine Size by 25%.

 ┗----Rationale: This one's been changed to suit more of a spray-and-pray style, hence the reload and mag size bonuses.

Ranger (high damage, extra crit) - No change.

Clipper (higher fire rate, lower damage) - No change.

Repeater (extra crit) - Increased Damage and Fire Rate by 18%.

Carbine (higher damage, lower fire rate) - No change.

Longrider (less pellets, more accuracy) - Increased Critical Damage by 30% and Reload Speed by 20%.

Scattergun (burst-fire-ish) - No change.

Stagecoach (more pellets, less accuracy) - No change.

Cheechako (higher fire rate, lower damage) - Increased Damage by 10%.

Calipeen - No change.

Muckamuck (high damage, high crit) - No change.


MALIWAN;

Legendary
---------
Beacon - Set reload-nova damage to 8.2 times card damage, reduced magazine size by 50%, improved reload speed by 40%, increased fire rate by 40%, increased splash radius by 50%.

 ┗----Rationale: The special feature of the Beacon is largely ignored due to standard gun usage being far superior compared to the reload-nova. The changes made allow the Beacon to be effective both with simply firing the weapon or using the gimmick.

Free Radical - No change.

Frozen Devil - Increased Ice Spike damage by 1000%, reduced Cryogenic-Mode frozen damage bonus to 2 times card damage.

 ┗----Rationale: Slowly freezing an enemy in order to be able to deal sufficient damage isn't the most enjoyable gameplay loop. The Ice Spike mode is now efficient enough for standard combat while the freeze-for-bonus-damage gimmick is worth considering on tough enemies.

Grease Trap - Set Grease Mode grease damage to 10% of card damage, reduced Grease Mode fire rate by 38%.

Hellshock - Reduced projectile count to 1.

Hyper-Hydrator - No change.

Ice Pick - No change.

Sellout - No change.

Superball - Doubled splash radius, made it fully automatic, added 50% critical hit damage.

 ┗----Rationale: Making fully-automatic is a quality-of-life change for your fingers, the critical hit damage is to reward skillful bouncing, and the splash radius boost is to discourage getting point-blank in something's face to reap the critical damage benefits.

Thunderball Fists - Splash radius doubled, ammo cost set to 1, made the thunderball faster.

Blind Sage - No change.

Chandelier - Ammo cost reduced by 2.

Frequency - Magazine size increased by 6.

 ┗----Rationale: Depending on the parts, you would not be able to use the maximum bonus of this weapon. The extra mag size remedies that.

Insider - Ammo cost reduced by 1.

Kill-o'-the-Wisp - No change.

Mind-Killer - No change.

Nothingness - Set "flak" damage to 2.5 times card damage.

Projectile Recursion - No change.

Trevanator - No change.

Vosk's Deathgrip - Ammo cost reduced to 3, secondary mode ammo-regeneration delay set to 4 seconds.

 ┗----Rationale: The intended play-loop for this weapon revolves around using the singularity to immobolize enemies so that you can zap the daylights out of them with the primary fire. The secondary regeneration delay change now allows you to reliably do that.

Cloud Kill - No change.

Cutsman - Damage-over-time reduced by 40%.

Destructo Spinner - No change.

Devoted - Fire rate reduced by 25%, recoil height improved by 30%, recoil width improved by 65%, improved accuracy.

D.N.A. - No change.

Ember's Purge - Puddle damage set to 33% of card damage, puddle chance increased to 33%.

Flipper - No change.

ION LASER - Set sustained-fire damage bonus to 7.5% per stack.

Kyb's Worth - No change.

P2P Networker - No change.

Plasma Coil - No change.

Polyaimorous - Set chain damage to 40% of card damage.

S.F. Force - Set note damage to 50% of card damage, fixed alternate mode not receiving damage buff properly.

Tsunami - No change.

Vault Hero - No change.

Westergun - Splash radius doubled.

ASMD - Set energy ball explosion to five times card damage.

Binary Operator - No change.

Complex Root - No change.

Firestorm - Ammo cost set to 1, fireball radius set to 400.

Krakatoa - Reduced speed of fireballs by roughly 18%.

 ┗----Rationale: Reducing the speed of the fireballs means they don't go quite as high and land closer to the volcano.

Storm - Ammo cost set to 1, radius set to 300.

Unique

Moxxi's Vibra-Pulse - Lifesteal set to 1.5%.

Emperor's Condiment - No change.

Soleki Protocol - No change.

Melter (higher damage, lower fire rate, charge to double damage, splash) - No change.

Devourer (impacts for 10% of damage, then explodes for card damage) - Increased Damage by 40%, Magazine Size by 20%, and reduced Fire Rate by 30%.

Quasar (shoots continuous beam, hits twice per ammo) - No change.

Pulsar (higher fire rate, slightly lower damage) - No change.

Nebula (higher damage, lower fire rate, splash) - No change.

Heliophage (no charge speed) - Increased Damage by 120% and reduced Fire Rate by 35%.

Terminator (charge for automatic fire) - Increase magazine size by two.

Cyclotron (hold to fire a three round burst) - Improved Projectile Charge Speed by 30%, Recoil Reduction by 40%, and Damage by 75%.

Shockwave (higher pellet count, higher damage per pellet, single shockwave shot) - No change.

Interloper (fires disks that bounce once) - Increased Damage by 400%, reduced Damage-over-Time by 40%, and reduced Ammo Cost by 2.

Proton Rifle (hold to charge power, splash) - Increased Damage by 30%.

Multiplex (hold to fire automatically) - Increased Damage by 30%.

Particle Rifle (hold for three-round burst fire) - No change.

Antimatter Rifle (penetrates targets, deals double the card damage) - Increased Damage by 85%, reduced Magazine Size by 35%, and Ammo Cost reduced by 1.


TEDIORE;

Legendary
---------
Baby Maker - No change.

Bangarang - No change.

Gunerang - No change.

S3RV-8OS-EXECUTE - No change.

Scorpio - Reload damage doubled.

Anarchy - Set damage per stack to 10%, set accuracy penalty to 10% per stack.

 ┗----Rationale: The Anarchy's gimmick is more power for less accuracy. The accuracy penalty has been increased enough to actually matter.

Brightside - Reload-shot damage set to 1.5 times the card damage.

Creeping Death - Explosion damage set to 70%, status effect damage reduced by 40%, projectile speed increased by 50%.

 ┗----Rationale: The damage on this thing's been increased a truckload. It's now useable both for traditional use and the "mine-laying" gimmick.

Flama Diddle - No change.

Manic Pixie Dream Gun - No change.

Polybius - Magazine size doubled.

 ┗----Rationale: Polybius' identity is high fire rate, and thus a higher magazine size helps to make use of that fire rate.

The Horizon - No change.

Dark Army - Drone damage reduced to 25% of card damage.

Long Musket - No change.

Needle Gun - Set damage stack to 4%, set base-reload damage to 2.5 times card damage.

Mother Too - Fire rate increased by 140%.

P.A.T. Mk. III - No change.

Regular
---------
Quickshot (Higher fire rate, lower damage, reload is self-firing gun) - No change.

Deadshot (reload is detonating red globe) - Increased Magazine Size by 25%.

Sureshot (Higher damage, lower fire rate, bigger mag, reload is multi-projectile) - No change.

Lurkshot (impacts for 10% of damage, then explodes for card damage, reload produces puddle) - Increased Damage by 90% and Magazine Size by 40%.

Excelerator (higher fire rate, lower damage, reload is self-firing gun) - No change.

Kill-O-Matic (reload is detonating red globe) - No change.

Keenfire (Higher damage, lower fire rate, reload is multi-projectile) - No change.

Gibbergun (shots penetrate, reload produces puddle) - Increased Damage by 85%, reduced Fire Rate by 20%, and Magazine Size increased by 5 bullets.

Fastblast (Higher damage per pellet, less pellets, higher fire rate. Reload is self-firing gun) - No change.

Everblast (Bigger magazine, reload is multi-projectile) - No change.

Powerblast (Higher pellet count, lower fire rate, reload is detonating red globe) - No change.

Elderblast (lobs explosive globs, reload produces puddle) - Increased Damage by 775%, reduced Tediore Reload Damage by 40%, and reduced Damage-over-Time by 40%.


TORGUE;

Legendary
---------
Alchemist - No change.

Bearcat - No change.

Contained Blast - Consecutive-hit bonus set to 2.5% per stack.

Hotfoot Teddy - No change.

Juliet's Dazzle - No change.

Laser-Sploder - No change.

Lovable Rogue - No change.

Try-Bolt - No change.

Breeder - Child projectile gravity increased by 76%, splash radius increased to 150.

 ┗----Rationale: The increased gravity allows the child projectiles to fall much faster, and the radius boost helps to ensure those explosions actually hit something.

Craps - No change.

Devastator - No change.

Devil's Foursum - Splash radius set to 275, projectile speed increased by 20%.

 ┗----Rationale: Gearbox overbuffed the radius on this thing, so the radius has been adjusted to still have a decently large explosion without outright taking the player down in the process.

Echo - No change.

Girth Blaster Elite - No change.

Moonfire - Critical hit damage set to 50%, amp damage set to 100%, accuracy improved by 60%, vertical recoil improved by 135%, horizontal recoil improved by 35%, weapon sway heavily reduced by 90%, equip time improved by 40%.

 ┗----Rationale: This thing's meant to be a hand cannon, so it has been touched up everything to allow it to be an effective hand cannon despite the lack of a proper sight.

Occultist - Accuracy penalty removed, splash radius set to 100, main projectile speed reduced by 50%, child projectile speed increased by 140%.

 ┗----Rationale: The initial projectile being slow allows it to spawn more projectiles before it hits something.

Prompt Critical - Sticky impact damage set to 40% of card damage.

Roisen's Thorns - No change.

Scoville - No change.

TNTina - Projectile Speed increased by 50%, fuse time lowered to 2 seconds, set Splash Radius to 175, increased Fire Rate by 45%.

Unkempt Harold - Base splash radius set to 100, projectiles now split 25% earlier, projectile speed reduced by 20%.

Creamer - Lifesteal set to 1.5%.

Hive - Ammo cost set to 3.

Nukem - Now deals radiation damage instead of kinetic damage.

 ┗----Rationale: It's a nuclear warhead launcher called the Nukem with a literal radiation symbol on the weapon's skin, in a game with nukes that actually deal radiation damage (Hammerdown Protocol and Baby Nukes). If any weapon deserves to be a radiation-element weapon, it is this one.

Plaguebearer - No change.

Quadomizer - No change.

R.Y.N.A.H. - Ammo cost set to 5, splash radius increased.

Satisfaction - Explosion delay reduced to 1 second from 2 seconds.

Scourge - Ammo cost set to 3, splash radius increased by 50%.

 ┗----Rationale: Reducing the ammo cost no longer means the Plaguebearer is effectively a direct upgrade to the Scourge.

Tunguska - Explosion radius increased by 68%.

Critical Thug - Updated description to be more accurate.

Flakker - Ammo cost increased to 4, initial projectile speed increased by 400%, initial projectile acceleration reduced by 33%, max initial projectile speed lowered 33%, subsequent projectile speed reduced by 33%. 

 ┗----Rationale: The changes allow the initial shot to go further from the player, and the explosions are more compact.

Redline - No change.

Shocker - No change.

Spade - No change.

The Boring Gun - Now launches initial projectile at high speed, gravity of projectile lowered considerably, reload speed improved by 38%, 75% critical hit damage bonus added.

 ┗----Rationale: The changes allow the Boring Gun to not be dead-weight against anything beyond point-blank range. The ideal shot is to land it right before an enemy's feet, but the critical hit damage bonus allows it to still have some use against airborne enemies.

The Lob - No change.

Tiggs' Boom - Meteor damage increased to 10 times card damage, meteor radius set to 450.

Unique
---------
Amber Management - Anger damage bonus per stack set to 10%, Happiness ammo-regenerate delay set to 10 seconds.

Magnum (higher projectile speed, lower fire rate) - No change.

Pocket Rocket (higher damage) - No change.

Carbuncle (impacts for 10% of damage, then explodes for card damage, launches multiple shots) - No change.

Flogger (Higher fire rate, lower damage) - No change.

Polisher (Higher projectile speed) - Increased Damage by 14% and increased Fire Rate by 18%.

Stranger (Higher damage, lower fire rate) - No change.

Blister (Spews flames, hits five times for two ammo, does a bit over twice the listed card damage, increases in damage for continuous damage up to 94%, short range) - Increased the Damage by 50% and Magazube Size by 10%.

Bologna Poney (higher splash radius)- Increased Damage by 35%.

Kielbasa (higher projectile speed, higher damage per projectile) - Increased Fire Rate by 25%.

Bangstick (higher projectile count, lower damage per projectile) - No change.

Protuberance (launches explosive globs that divides into triple the explosive globs on impact) - No change.

Threeway (multiple projectiles) - No change.

Hedgehog (higher damage, splash radius)- No change.

Quickie (higher fire rate, higher magazine size) - Reduced Magazine Size by 1 to compensate for Torgue Heavy Weapon Mag Size Buff.

Lump - No change.


VLADOF;

Legendary
---------
Damned - No change.

Dowsing Rod - Reduced damage of underbarrel by 35%, lowered the accuracy of the underbarrel by 150%.

 ┗----Rationale: The underbarrel still does sufficient damage, now it just able to spread that damage out more without increasing the splash radius.

Faisor - Underbarrel ammo regeneration delay set to .75 seconds, underbarrel regeneration rate set to .75 rounds per second, underbarrel ammo set to 8.

 ┗----Rationale: The underbarrel is one of the defining features of the Faisor. The ammo regeneration changes make it useable consistently.

Lucian's Call - No change.

Ogre - Accuracy considerably improved, fire rate increased by 80%.

The Dictator - Changed how the underbarrel works to benefit better from the Double grip.

 ┗----Rationale: The Dictator's underbarrel adds four projectiles to your shots regardless of whether or not your weapon has the grip that doubles projectile count. It has been changed to increase projectile count by 2.67 times (which works out to 7 shots on a normal Dictator and 16 on a double variant.)

The Monarch - Ammo cost set to 2, magazine size increased by 70%, movement speed penalty while deployed increased to 50%, changed how the underbarrel works to benefit better from the Double grip.

 ┗----Rationale: The Monarch was basically Dictator 2.0. Rather than chunking the damage, the ammo cost was increased and movement speed penalty to make it worth considering the Dictator over the Monarch at times. The Monarch underbarrel now increases to 10 and 20 projectiles for normal and double variants respectively when using the underbarrel.

Shredifier - Super Shredifier's underbarrel accuracy and recoil are now the same as a standard double barrel, added a second projectile to the Super Shredifier underbarrel, increased ammo cost of the Super Shredifier underbarrel by one, reduced damage of the Super Shredifier underbarrel by 25%. (x2 variants will produce four projectiles and consume four ammo.)

 ┗----Rationale: The Super Shredifier's underbarrel technically was worse than the regular double barrel for Vladof assault rifles. It has been given some tweaks to really drive home the theme of "more dakka".

Sickle - Made the Boom Sickle have the same stats as a standard Sickle as well as properly getting boosted by Assault Rifle Damage, heavily improved accuracy and recoil, reload speed improved, magazine size increased by 12.

 ┗----Rationale: This weapon seems to be intended as a throwback to the Hammer from Borderlands 1. The various stat changes now allow it to fulfill the role of a high fire-rate shotgun-ish weapon.

Web Slinger - Cryo projectile chance set to 33%, underbarrel damage set to 20 times card damage, underbarrel splash radius set to 500, number of underbarrel projectiles reduced to 1 from 2, set underbarrel ammo regeneration delay to 3 seconds.

 ┗----Rationale: The underbarrel was seemingly designed to hit like a truck but never really seemed to accomplish that. The changes made to it hopefully fix that.

Firefly - Damage of firefiles set to 30% of card damage, speed of initial projectile increased ten-fold, child projectile initial speed reduced by 50%, child projectile max speed increased by 650%, fixed a typo in the description.

 ┗----Rationale: What this translates to is that the bullets fired from the gun go faster, the fireflies spread out less from impact, and they quickly fly after a target.

Infinity - No change.

Light Show - No change.

Magnificent - Added an ability that increases fire rate based on how large your magazine is. Removed accuracy and recoil penalties.

 ┗----Rationale: A giant magazine size isn't an especially interesting mechanic. So to get some use from the "Mag" in Magnificent, it has been given something that encourages going hog-wild with magazine size boosts. With enough mag size boosts you can hit a triple-digit increase in fire rate (up to 150% if you go maximum gear and skill investment on Moze.)

Miscreant - No change.

Backburner - Child projectile damage reduced by 50%.

ION CANNON - x1 ION CANNONs now consume 4 ammo while x2 ION CANNONs still consume 7.

 ┗----Rationale: X2 ION CANNONS are still going to doleing out more damage, but the reduced ammo cost of the x1 version gives it a niche of ammo efficiency.

Jericho - Increased splash radius by 25%, made initial projectile fly slower and fly upward less, increased child projectile speed by 500% and detonate on impact instead of bouncing.

Kickcharger - Maximum charge damage multiplier reduced to 100% from 400%.

 ┗----Rationale: One shouldn't be able to instantly quadruple their damage by sliding. Doubling it is enough.

Mongol - Increased splash radius by 70%.

Rocket Pod - No change.

Boogeyman - Skull damage reduced to 2000% card damage from 2500% card damage.

Lyuda - Critical hit damage bonus removed.

Septimator Prime - Starfall chance set to 20%, starfall damage set to match card damage, cooldown for starfall chance set to 1 second, rocket launcher underbarrel delay removed, rocket underbarrel ammo regen rate set to 0.225 rounds per second, shotgun underbarrel ammo regen delay lowered to 1.4 seconds, shotgun ammo regen rate set to 0.6 rounds per second.

ANSHIN;

Legendary
---------
Asclepius - Capacity increased by 65%, recharge rate improved by 70%, recharge delay improved by 40%, damage-over-time resistance while shields are down increased to 100%, health regen increased to 10%, fixed nova damage not scaling with level and increased nova radius by 33%.

 ┗----Rationale: If you're going to go through hell-and-high-water to get this thing, it should be worth your effort. At least in terms of general defensive capability, it should now be top-notch.

Back Ham - Rear-damage resistance increased to 75%.

Badass Combustor - No change.

Frozen Heart - Reduced lifesteal to 5%.

Infernal Wish - No change.

Scream of Terror - Nova radius increased by 66%, capacity and delay reduced by 50%, recharge rate doubled.

Snowshoe - Reduced lifesteal to 5%.

Super Soldier - Damage immunity reduced to a 33% damage reduction.

 ┗----Rationale: In a world without things such as the anointment for triggering shield effects or the Bloodletter, full-immunity might be fine. But in order the keep people from having perpetual God-mode active, the immunity's been toned down to a decent damage reduction.

Version 0.m - Fixed amp damage not applying to multi-projectile weapons properly.

Wattson - Disc-drop cooldown reduced to 1 second, projectile speed increased 25%.

Whiskey Tango Foxtrot - Doubled IED damage, increased IED chance to 40%, increased speed of launched IEDs by 50%, increased explosion radius 50%, reduced fuse time to 3 seconds, and made IEDs explode on impact with enemies.

 ┗----Rationale: The changes made will allow the IEDs to have a better chance of actually damaging the enemy while also reducing the risk of the wearer getting caught up in the explosions.

All-In - No change.

Initiative - Damage and resistance increased to 33%.

Moxxi's Embrace - No change.


HYPERION;

Legendary
---------
Faulty Star - Capacity increased by 50%.

Firewall - Damage reduction improved to 75%.

Front Loader - No change.

Gas Mask - No change.

Mana Well - Shock damage reduced to 50%, damage resistance reduced to 65%, description fixed to match damage resistance.

Old God - No change.

Re-Charge Berner - No change.

Re-Charger - No change.

Re-Volter - Shock damage and fire rate bonuses reduced to 25%.

Rectifier - Damage buffed by 2333%.

Stop-Gap - Damage immunity changed to 100% damage resistance.

 ┗----Rationale: Same situation as the Super Soldier. In order the keep people from having perpetual God-mode active, the immunity's been changed from 100% damage reduction (zero damage received) to 100% damage resistance (50% less damage received.)

The Transformer - No change.

Ward - Recharge delay made longer by 100%, recharge rate improved by 50%, health regeneration increased to 5%/10%, weapon damage replaced with damage-taken reduction.

 ┗----Rationale: The recharge delay reduction makes it easier to maintain empty shields while the roid is active. The capacity was not reduced since it helps as a buffer while first approaching an enemy. Weapon damage was replaced since the primary reason anyone uses this shield is for melee, hence the change to damage reduction being more useful.

Unique
---------
Brawler Unpaler - No change.

Golden Touch - No change.

Limit Break - No change.

Mr. Caffeine Shield - No change.

Revengenader - No change.


PANGOLIN;

Legendary
---------
Band of Sitorak - Fixed description to say 30% damage instead of 170%.

Big Boom Blaster - No change.

Black Hole - Capacity reduced by 50%, recharge rate buffed by 65%, improved recharge delay by 100%.

 ┗----Rationale: The stat changes allow the Black Hole to trigger the singularity more often.

Impaler - Capacity increased by 40%, spike damage increased by 340%, projectile speed increased by 260%.

Plus Ultra - No change.

Red Suit - Aura damage increased by 150%.

Shooting Star - Stars no longer collide with the world.

Stinger - Nova damage reduced from Nova-Berner levels of damage to standard nova-levels of damage.

 ┗----Rationale: Same story with the rest of the "Melee" gear, traditional melee should be the strongest form of melee. Stinger still has the advantage of a better delivery system as well as receiving splash bonuses.

Torch - Capacity reduced by 70%, recharge rate buffed by 75%, recharge delay improved by 10%, fireball damage increase by 80%, fireball speed increased by 200%, fireball explosion radius increased by 300%.

Class Mods

PASSIVES;
Weapon Type Damage - No change.

Area-of-Effect Damage - Reduced in effectiveness (20% at level 72.)

 ┗----Rationale: For how broad an effective range of gear it could buff, the bonus was excessive. It isn't locked to an element type, manufacturer, or weapon type and thus could potentially buff a player's entire arsenal.

Weapon Magazine Size - 33% less effective than vanilla, now also affects CoV heat rate.

 ┗----Rationale: While the Artifact-based magazine size boost is the bigger culprit, that one in conjunction with this one could more than double a player's magazine size. That's a bit excessive compared to other stat bonuses.

Action Skill Cooldown - No change.

Weapon Accuracy - No change.

Weapon Reload Speed - Increased in effectiveness (30% at level 72.)

Grenade Damage - No change.

Melee Damage - No change.

Shield Recharge Rate - No change.

Shield Recharge Delay - No change.

Element Resistance - No change.

Max Health - No change.

Health Regen - No change.

Shield Capacity - No change.

General Weapon Damage - No change.

Weapon Critical Damage - No change.

Received Damage Reduction - No change.

Weapon Handling - No change.

Splash Radius - Increased in effectiveness (50% at level 72.)

Grenade Radius - No change.

Grenade Capacity - Increased in effectiveness (+10 grenades at level 72.)

Weapon Fire Rate - Increased in effectiveness (30% at level 72.)

Weapon Charge Speed - No change.

Manufacturer Weapon Accuracy - No change.

Manufacturer Critical Damage - Reduced in effectiveness (35% at level 72.)

 ┗----Rationale: Since Manufacturer Damage is now more effective, it felt justified to reduce the damage of Manufacturer Crit. It causes less of a gap in performance between manufacturers that have a critical-boosting passive and ones that lack it.

Manufacturer Weapon Damage - Increased in effectiveness (40% at level 72.)

Manufacturer Fire Rate - Fire rate bonus made consistent across manufacturers, overall increase in effectiveness (40% at level 72.)

Manufacturer Reload Speed - Increased in effectiveness (50% at level 72.)

Torgue Weapon Projectile Speed - No change.

Action Skill Damage - No change.


NOTE ABOUT CLAS MOD CHANGES: Several skills were replaced with different skills. The reason why most of the base game class mods haven't had their skills touched is because they use the same part that regular, non-Legendary class mods use. Any exceptions to this are because only *that* class mod (in the base game) boosts the skill that has been replaced. DLC Class mods use different parts to boost their skills (even if they boost the same skill.) As to why the skill parts that can spawn on a class mod hasn't been changed, it is to prevent illegitimate class mods.

Moze

Legendary
---------
Bear Trooper - Replaced Explosive Punctuation with Vampyr.
 ┗----Rationale: Bear Trooper is all about getting as much up-time with the mechs active as possible. Vampyr is chosen as an option to help keep the mechs up and running.

Blast Master - No change.

Bloodletter - No change.

Eternal Flame - No change.

Flare - Replaced Stainless-Steel Bear with Desperate Measures, replaced Cloud of Lead with Stainless-Steel Bear, and replaced Means of Destruction with Deadlines.

 ┗----Rationale: Normally, Stainless-Steel Bear on the Flare can only have up to three parts. Rather than change what can spawn on the Flare, Stainless-Steel Bear has been replaced with Desperate Measures as an Iron Bear-damage boosting skill and Cloud of Lead replaced with Stainless-Steel Bear to effectively be able to have five points in Stainless-Steel Bear. Deadlines replaces Means of Destruction as a skill that moderately benefits Iron Bear.

Heat Exchanger - No change.

Sapper - Maximum lifesteal reduced to 6%, time needed to reach max lifesteal reduced by 50%. (Possibly consider replacing Means of Destruction with Click, Click.)

Green Monster - "Blast Master" splash damage effect removed, replaced Click, Click... with Forge.

 ┗----Rationale: Given how the splash bonus is never mentioned anywhere on the card it isn't unreasonable to assume it wasn't intended. Losing a 100% boost in splash damage is a big loss, so it has at least been somewhat compensated for by replacing Click, Click... with Forge (for whatever reason, Click, Click... can only spawn with one point on this class mod legitimately.) Bullet hose builds should appreciate this.

Mind Sweeper - No change.

Raging Bear - Damage and Fuel Bonuses now factor in skill/gear bonuses, Stoke the Embers replaced with Drowning in Brass.

Rocketeer - No change.


Zane

Legendary
---------
Antifreeze - No change.

Cold Warrior - Increased Damage-over-Time to 200% from 15%.

Conductor - No change.

Critical Mass - Replaced Déjà Vu with Headsman's Hand and Playing Dirty with Brain Freeze.

 ┗----Rationale: The class mod with the special effect of refilling your magazine on a critical kill also spawns with the skill that does the exact same thing. To curb this redundancy and keep in line with the theme of critical hits on this class mod, Headsman's Hand now gets boosted instead.

Executor - No change.

Hustler - Replaced Adrenaline with Violent Violence.

 ┗----Rationale: Violent Violence has been added as a means to build and cycle through Hustler stacks faster. Adrenaline did not particularly benefit the Hustler's playstyle.

Infiltrator - No change.

Seein' Dead - No change.

Shockerator - No change.

Spy - No change.

Techspert - SNTNL reset chance increased to 100%.

 ┗----Rationale: With the existence of things like the Spy and Seein' Dead allowing for immense action skill uptime, 100% chance to maintain SNTNL does not seem unreasonable.


Fl4k

Legendary
---------
3RROr Cmdl3t - Attack Command chance cooldown lowered to 1 second, replaced Better Toys with Sic 'Em, and replaced Keep Them Safe with Fuzzy Math.

 ┗----Rationale: Sic 'Em replaces Better Toys as a means to enhance the Attack Command-centric nature of this class mod, while Fuzzy Math is a more consistent means of shield restoration compared to Keep Them Safe.

Bounty Hunter - No change.

Cosmic Stalker - No change.

DE4DEYE - No change.

Friend-Bot - Pet damage bonus increased to 50%.

Peregrine - Replaced Ambush Predator with Grim Harvest.

R4kk P4k - No change.

Rakk Commander - Increased number of bonus Rakk charges to 3.

Roll Reversal - Replaced Eager to Impress with Go For The Eyes.

 ┗----Rationale: Go For The Eyes fits better with the theme of pet-based critical hits than Eager to Impress.

Red Fang - No change.

St4ckbot - No change.

Tr4iner - Dominate chance increased to 100%, Domination duration increased to 60 seconds.

 ┗----Rationale: There isn't a great deal going for this class mod, but you can at least use the dominated enemy to draw aggro away from yourself and your pet for a while now.


Amara

Legendary
---------
Breaker - Increased maximum damage reduction to 50%.

Death's Blessings - Blessing orb speed increased by 200%, Gun Damage changed to General Damage, damage changed back to factor in skill/gear boosts, damage bonus reduced to 50%.

 ┗----Rationale: The change to general damage means everything you do is going to deal more damage, including action skills and Remnant itself. This will hopefully lead to more uptime on this class mod's special effect.

Dragon - Replaced Remnant with Personal Space.

 ┗----Rationale: The Dragon's special effect only triggers when a Melee kill is made. To facilitate that, Personal Space (which has been changed to boost Melee damage as well) has been added.

Elementalist - Replace Wildfire with Anima.

Golden Rule - No change.

Kensei - Increased bonus damage duration to 10 seconds.

Muse - No change.

Nimbus - Increased cloud damage by 20%.

Phasezerker - No change.

Spiritual Driver - Gun damage bonus now also affects slide damage.

 ┗----Rationale: Like with the Violent Momentum change. It adds a bit of extra variety and makes logical sense that something moving fast hurts when it hits something.

Stone - Rush stack chance increased to 20% and replaced Violent Tapestry with Alacrity.



Artifacts


PASSIVES;
Weapon Type Damage - No change.

Area-of-Effect Damage - Reduced in effectiveness (25% at level 72), no longer increases splash radius.

 ┗----Rationale: Already covered in the Splash Damage notes in the Class Mod section. The radius removal helps stop or diminish issues with items such as the Complex Root or Sidewinder as well as making the actual passive stat for splash radius more valuable (which has been buffed to help compensate the loss of radius boosts with this stat.)

Weapon Magazine Size - Reduced in effectiveness (25% at level 72), now also affects CoV heat rate.

Action Skill Cooldown - No change.

Weapon Accuracy - Primary and Secondary now boost the same stuff (accuracy spread, recoil height/width, recoil-per-shot, max accuracy.)

Weapon Reload Speed - Increased in effectiveness (30% at level 72.)

Grenade Damage - No change.

Melee Damage - No change.

Shield Recharge Rate - No change.

Shield Recharge Delay - No change.

Element Resistance - No change.

Max Health - No change.

Health Regen - No change.

Shield Capacity - No change.

Movement Speed - No change.

Element Damage - No change.

Luck - Increased in effectiveness (+50 at level 72.)

FFYL Time - No change.

FFYL Movement Speed - No change.

General Elemental Resist - No change.

Element Chance/Cryo Efficiency - No change.

Experience from Combat - Increased in effectiveness (100% at level 72.)


Legendary
---------
Commander Planetoid - Increased bonus elemental melee damage to 130% regardless of level, timer between elemental switching reduced to 0.1 seconds.

Company Man - No change.

Cosmic Crater - Tripled the damage of the puddles.

Deathless - No change.

Deathrattle - No change.

Electric Banjo - Bullet proc chance increased to 33%, melee proc chance reduced to 33%, UI now mentions melee chance.

Grave - Gun damage and splash damage bonuses doubled.

Holy Grail - Maximum health bonus increased to 17%/34%/50%, post-Second Wind movement speed increased to 50%.

Launch Pad - No change.

Loaded Dice - No change.

Lunacy - Recharge rate penalty improved to -100% from -216%.

Moxxi's Endowment - Changed completely. Now called the "Naught" and it trades 75% of your shield's capacity for instant shield recharging.

 ┗----Rationale: In Borderlands 2 the Endowment at least had the distinction of being the only artifact that increased experience gain (and even then, it wasn't a particularly good artifact.) This is Borderlands 3 though, and experience gain is a passive stat that can roll on almost any artifact. Rather than just buffing the Endowment's experience gain heavily, it is now an item that is useful regardless of level and should expand build-making possibilities.

Otto Idol - No change.

Phoenix Tears - Fight-for-your-life duration and fight-for-your-life movement speed increased by 50% each, 10% health regeneration per second added.

 ┗----Rationale: The main effect of this artifact is made redundant by a simple Guardian Perk, so it has been given some other bonuses to aid in survivability.

Pull Out Method - Cooldown reduced to 3 seconds.

Rocket Boots - Increased rokcet damage by 300%.

Safeguard - No change.

Shlooter - No change.

Splatter Gun - Increased shotgun damage bonus to 100%.

Static Charge - Made the description of the ability more accurate.

The Pearl of Ineffable Knowledge - Damage for the first 15 stacks increased to 3.33%, damage for the final stack reduced to 50%.

 ┗----Rationale: Instead of gaining a pitiful amount of damage for the first few shots, now you gain a decent chunk of damage before getting the final bonus.

Toboggan - Amp damage lowered to 70%.

Unleash the Dragon - Damage-over-time reduced to 10% from 80%.

 ┗----Rationale: For normal melee, this generally wouldn't be an issue. The existence of things like the Fish Slap and Status Effect Crit Nova Anointment however merits a considerable nerf in the DoTs of this artifact.

Victory Rush - No change.

White Elephant - Damage increased to 140% from 50%.

Unique
---------
Mysterious Artifact - No change.

Road Warrior - Increased damage of the sawblades by 66%.

Vendetta - Reduced lifesteal to 7.5%.

Regular
---------
Atom Balm - Radius increased to 50%.

Cutpurse - No change.

Electric Slide - Tesla damage increased by 150%, increased the slide impact damage bonus per level by 300%.

Elemental Projector - No change.

Elemental Stones - Increased melee damage bonus to 100% regardless of level.

Flesh Melter - No change.

Hot Drop - Reduced fireball damage by 50%.

Ice Breaker - No change.

Ice Spiker - Increased icicle damage by 100%.

Knife Drain - Lifesteal reduced to 15%.

Last Stand - Cooldown reduced to 30 seconds.

Loot Expanding - No change.

Mind Melt - No change.

Radiodead - Increased the slide impact damage bonus per level by 300%.

Rear Ender - Increased base damage by five times, increased damage bonus per level by 2.52 times.

Spark Plug - No change.

Snowdrift - Increased the slide impact damage bonus per level by 300%, reduced the damage of the snowball by roughly 57%.

Toxic Revenger - No change.


###########
ANOINTMENTS

Many of the anointsments below have been adjusted to "now factor in skill and gear bonuses." What this means for example is that before if you had 1000% Weapon Damage from skills and gear in an unmodded game of Borderlands 3, and used the 100% weapon damage anointment it'd only be 1100% total. With it factoring in gear and skill boosts however, the 25% Weapon Damage anointment causes that 1000% weapon damage to become 1250%.

General
----------------------
150/90 - Reduced to 70%.

U-Rad - Reduced to 50%.

Active Novas - Damage reduced to 2 from 7.5, frequency increased to 1 per second, increased radius 50%.

Killstack - Reduced to 3% for both bonuses and now factors in skill and gear bonuses.

Conc Hits - Reduced to 0.25% damage per stack and now factors in skill and gear bonuses.

 ┗----Rationale: It may seem like a tiny number, but by making it affect gears and skills each stack now has slightly greater effect than the one before it. It ends up being notably stronger than 25% at 100 stacks.

25/50 Low-Health Kill - Increased damage bonus to 100%.

######
SKILLS


Moze

Updated the descriptions of many skills to either mention Iron Cub whenever Iron Bear is mentioned or otherwise be more accurate to the skill's in-game effects.

Shield of Retribution
----------------------
Selfless Vengeance - Increased Incendiary Bonus to 4% per point, increased bonus seconds-per-point to 2 from 1.

Security Bear - No change.

Armored Infantry - No change.

Drowning in Brass - Iron Bear damage boost changed to a type that affects both arms (same as Stainless Steel Bear's.)

Thin Red Line - No change.

Vladof Ingenuity - No change.

Full Can of Whoop-Ass - No change.

Experimental Munitions - No change.

Behind the Iron Curtain - Increased recharge rate and delay bonuses to 15% per point.

Desperate Measures - No change.

Phalanx Doctrine - No change.

Force Feedback - Increased shield restore to 15%.

Tenacious Defense - No change.

Demolition Woman
----------------
Fire in the Skag Den - No change.

Deadlines - No change.

Grizzled - No change.

Means of Destruction - No change.

Torgue Cross-Promotion - No change.

Stainless Steel Bear - Increased Iron Bear Damage per point to 6%.

Pull the Holy Pin - No change.

Auto Bear - No change.

Vampyr - Reduced Lifesteal to 0.6% per point.

Why Can't I Carry All These Grenades - Now boosts two grenades per point. Added a 10%-per-point Grenade Damage bonus.

 ┗----Rationale: Unless the skill was made to add a copious amount of grenades, nobody would want this. Grenade damage is a nice incentive to pick this skill up.

To The Last - No change.

Explosive Punctuation - Increased duration to 5 seconds.

Short Fuse - No change.

Bottomless Mags
----------------
Cloud of Lead - No change.

Dakka Bear - No change.

Matched Set - No change.

Stoke the Embers - No change.

Redistribution - No change.

Scrappy - No change.

Rushin' Offensive - Reduced lifesteal to 1%.

Scorching RPM's - Increased Iron Bear Damage per point to 7%.

The Iron Bank - Added a 5%-per-point bonus to reload speed.

Specialist Bear - Reduced the damage bonus to 30%.

 ┗----Rationale: 60% damage bonus is certainly a boon for damage but it effectively kills the desire to mix and match weapon types for versatility. 30% is still enough to merit investing in for more damage but not so much that you wouldn't want to try combinations of different weapons.

Some for the Road - A second point in Some For The Road now increases duration by 5 seconds.

Click, Click... - No change.

Forge - Increased bonus to 12.5%.

Bear Mother
----------------
Biofuel - No change.

Big Surplus - No change.

Really Big Guns - No change.

Double Time - Increased bonus to 6.66% per point.

Harmonious Havoc - No change.

Explosive Fury - No change.

Fired Up - Fixed burst-fire delay being increased by this skill.

Nitrotrinadium Engines - No change.

Never Gonna Give You Up - No change.

Feature Creep - No change.

Limit Break - No change.

Superior Firepower - No change.

Running on Fumes - No change.

Action Skills/Augments
----------------------
Iron Bear - Reduced Duration and Cooldown to 60 seconds.

 ┗----Rationale: With a reduction in the cooldown time needed to regain Iron Bear, Moze has more access to anointments and is less reliant on Topped Off. For the reduction in duration as a balancing factor since cooldown was lowered, in a choice between maintaining Iron Bear's power or Iron Bear's duration the mech's power was chosen to be more useful to more builds instead of having a long-lasting but weaker mech.

Iron Cub - No change.


Railgun - No change.

Hell on Rails - No change.

Capacitive Armature - Reduced splinter damage to 40% from 70%.

Corrosive Sabot - Reduced initial damage to 85% from 97%, reduced explosion damage to 50% from 60%.

Bear Fist - Increased damage by 347%, reduced fuel consumption by 70%.

 ┗----Rationale: For something that can only be used point-blank range, it should pack a wallop and have better efficiency than what it had before. 

Wild Swing - No change.

Close the Distance - Reduced cooldown between shots to 2 seconds from 3, reduced fuel consumption by 70%.

Shockhammer - No change.

Vanquisher Rockets - No change.

Active Tracking - Reduced the time needed between homing locks to 0.15 seconds from 0.25 seconds.

Target Softening - No change.

Hammerdown Protocol - No change.

V-35 Grenade Launcher - Improved fuel consumption by 25%.

Shaped Charge - No change.

Musical Chairs - Increased damage of singularity grenade to 0.4 from 0.17, now deploys a singularity every 5th grenade.

Lock and Speedload - No change.

Salamander Flamethrowers - Increased damage by 250%, increased fire rate to 8 from 3, reduced damage-over-time by 35%, adjusted fuel consumption to account for increased fire rate.

 ┗----Rationale: Similar to the Bear Fist rationale but to a lesser extent. Limited range should equate a better performance within that range.

Fuel Economy - Adjusted fuel consumption to account for the above changes, fixed the display for movement speed being double the actual value, increased the actual movement speed bonus to 30%, and increased duration to 4 seconds.

Chemical Warfare - No change.

Molten Roar - Increased damage by 242%.

Miniguns - No change.

Let Off Some Steam - No change.

General Winter - No change.

Exploding. Bullets. - No change.

Fuel for the Fire - No change.

Baby Nukes - No change.

My Little Friend - No change.

Efficiency Engine - No change.



Zane

Doubled Agent
-------------
Synchronicity - No change.

Praemunitas - No change.

Borrowed Time - No change.

Donnybrook - No change.

Fractal Frags - No change.

Duct Tape Mod - Removed Gun-Splash Immunity. Grenade immunity remains. Fixed the skill description saying it had a cooldown of 4 seconds instead of 8.

 ┗----Rationale: Duct Tape mod making you immune to your own grenades makes sense due to the fact it may suddenly spawn a grenade right in your face when you're up close and personal to an enemy. Splash immunity just dumbs down Zane's gameplay and leads to things like Complex Root spam.

Quick Breather - No change.

Pocket Full of Grenades - Added a 5%-per-point bonus to grenade damage.

Old-U - No change.

Supersonic Man - No change.

Like a Ghost - Increased base dodge chance to 8.33% per point from 5%, reduced bonus dodge chance to 3.33% from 5%, made it stack only once.

 ┗----Rationale: Reducing the stack count to one means the base bonus for the skill can be increased to a desireable level without making it too strong if it could stack twice.

Boom. Enhance. - Increased the clone health bonus per grenade to 100%.

Trick of the Light - Changed Cryo Damage back to Shock Damage.

Double Barrel - Changed gun damage to general damage and reduced damage bonus to 20%.

Hitman
-------------
Violent Speed - No change.

Cold Bore - No change.

Violent Momentum - Now also increases slide damage.

 ┗----Rationale: If an old man slides into your kneecaps at hyperspeed, logically speaking it should hurt more than if he slides into you at a brisk jog. It also opens up some fun avenues for alternate damage.

Cool Hand - No change.

Drone Delivery - Reduced cooldown to 10 seconds.

Salvation - Reduced lifesteal to 0.2% per point from 2%, allowed grenades to receive lifesteal form this skill.

Seein' Red - No change.

Violent Violence - Fixed burst-fire delay being increased by this skill.

Playing Dirty - No change.

Good Misfortune - No change.

Death Follows Close - No change.

Under Cover
-------------
Adrenaline - No change.

Hearty Stock - Increased capacity per point to 16.66%.

Ready for Action - No change.

Brain Freeze - No change.

Stiff Upper Lip - No change.

Rise to the Occasion - No change.

Distributed Denial - No change.

Really Expensive Jacket - No change.

Best Served Cold - Nova damage doubled, cooldown removed.

Futility Belt - Increased damage resistance to 30%.

Refreshment - Reduced lifesteal to 1% per point.

Calm, Cool, Collected - Increased health regeneration to 5%.

Nerves of Steel - Increased accuracy and handling bonuses to 2.66% per point, added 1%-per-point critical hit damage.

Confident Competence - Changed gun damage to all-purpose damage and increased the maximum damage bonus to 50%.

 ┗----Rationale: Zane's got tons of gun damage, but not a great deal of other damage. A 50% increase to all damage should make it worthwhile to reach this capstone.

The Professional
-------------
Man of Focus - No change.

Renegade - No change.

Deja Vu - No change.

Headman's Hand - No change.

Tunnel Vision - No change.

Commitment - No change.

Fugitive - No change.

Domino Effect - Fixed burst-fire delay being increased by this skill.

Art of War - Reduced max stack amount to 3, increased damage per point to 6.66%.

 ┗----Rationale: Most people aren't going to waste time activating ten Action Skills for a one-time increase to damage. Three is a more reasonable number.

Sheer Will - No change.

Eraser - No change.

Our Man Flynt - No change.

Action Skills/Augments
----------------------
Barrier - Reduced cooldown to 16 seconds from 24 seconds, increase amp damage to 40% on the ground (28% while held).

 ┗----Rationale: The increase in amp damage and the reduction of Lifesteal should encourage more usage of the Barrier.

Charged Relay - Replaced reload speed with fire rate, increase maximum movement speed to 40%, increased maximum fire rate to 35%.

 ┗----Rationale: Two augments in the same tree shouldn't be boosting the exact same stat. Thus the reload speed has been replaced with fire rate.

Nanites or Some Shite - Increased maximum health regen to 10%, increase reload speed bonus to 33%, increase shield delay bonus to 50%.

All-Rounder - No change.

Retaliation - Changed the gun damage to general damage and increased the damage bonus to 20%.

Deterrence Field - No change.

Digi-Clone - Increased base health by roughly 11%.

Binary System - Increased damage by 140%.

Schadenfreude - No change.

Which One's Real - No change.

Winter's Drone - No change.

Bad Dose - No change.

Static Field - No change.

Boomsday - No change.

Almighty Ordinance - No change.

MNTIS Shoulder Cannon - No change.

Colder Shoulder - Removed damage penalty.

Wetwork - Increased explosion damage by 122%, increased radius by 192%.

Brain Drain - No change.

No Way Out - No change.

Proliferation - No change.



Fl4k

Hunter
-------------
Interplanetary Stalker - No change.

Leave No Trace - No change.

Second Intention - Increased reload speed bonuses (25%/50% at 5/5)

Hunter's Eye - No change.

Head Count - No change.

Ambush Predator - No change.

Two F4ng - Increased bonus projectile chance to 7% per point.

Big Game - No change.

The Most Dangerous Game - No change.

Galactic Shadow - No change.

Grim Harvest - No change.

Megavore - No change.

Master
-------------
Ferocity - No change.

Persistance Hunter - No change.

Go for the Eyes - No change.

Who Rescued Who? - No change.

He Bites - No change.

Frenzy - No change.

Psycho Head on a Stick - Increased movement speed bonus to 25%.

Hive Mind - Increased damage sharing to 8.33% per point.

Barbaric Yawp - No change.

Mutated Defenses - No change.

Pack Tactics - No change.

Shared Spirit - No change.

Dominance - No change.

Stalker
-------------
Self-Repairing System - No change.

Sic 'Em - Increased cooldown bonus to 16.66% per point from 10%.

Furious Attack - No change.

Eager to Impress - No change.

All My BFF's - No change.

Overclocked - Increased to 4% fire rate and 4% post-reload fire rate per point.

Lick the Wounds - No change.

Turn Tail and Run - No change.

The Fast and the Furryous - No change.

Hidden Machine - No change.

Rage and Recover - Fixed skill description to be total health instead of missing health.

The Power Within - No change.

Trapper
-------------
Gotta Go Fast - No change.

Success Imminent - No change.

Agility Training - No change.

Better Toys - Increased recharge rate and delay bonuses to 10% per point each.

Combat Veterinarian - No change.

Throatripper - Increased critical hit chance to 10% per point.

Lethal Force Authorized - Increased respawn rate cooldown to 300%.

Take This! - No change.

Monkey Do! - No longer removes elements, changed amp type to behave better with multi-projectile weapons, changed skill description to reflect that it is always 81% bonus amp regardless of points invested.

Wooly Armor - No change.

Not Even a Challenge - No change.

Fuzzy Math - No change.

Keep Them Safe - No change.

Capacitance - No change.

Action Skills/Augments
----------------------
Rakk Attack - Increased damage by 25% and added a note to the skill description mentioning that Splash bonuses apply to this action skill and its augments.

Rakk Open a Cold One - No change.

Falconer's Feast - No change.

Flock n' Load - No change.

Rakkcelerate - No change.

Gamma Burst - No change.

Atomic Aroma - Increased aura damage by roughly 300%.

Empathic Rage - No change.

Endurance - Increased time earned per kill to 5 seconds.

Burst Aid - Increased heal regeneration to 33%.

Fade Away - No change.

Guerillas in the Mist - No change.

Not My Circus - No change.

Until You Are Dead - No change.

Unblinking Eye - No change.

Gravity Snare - Reduced cooldown to 16 seconds from 36, increased pulse frequency to once every second from 4 seconds.

 ┗----Rationale: Gravity Snare isn't doing Fl4k any favors for damage, but it can at least be turned into a good crowd control skill. With it pulsing every second it effectively disables enemies for the duration of the skill, and the lowered cooldown means it it more readily available than something like Red Fang/Gamma Burst.

Forage - Drop amount and booster shield-restoration reduced due to increasing the frequency of gravity pulses increasing the frequency of producing items.

Wide Net - No change.

Trap Card - Changed description to mention that the trap is free when deployed while entering FFYL.

Blind With Anger - No change.

Pets
-------------
Increased base pet melee damage, ranged damage, and skill damage by 20%.

Improved attack command cooldown by 50%.

 ┗----Rationale: Attack Command is one of those things seldom used because you can only use them once in a while and tend to forget about it in the heat of combat. A reduction in cooldown should remedy that.

Spiderant Centurion - No change.

Spiderant Scorcher - Increased aura damage by 233%.

Spiderant Countess - Increased damage reduction bonus to 10%.

Guard Skag - No change.

Great Horn Skag - Increased gun damage bonus to 10%, increased ram attack damage by 150%.

Eridian Skag - Increased fire rate bonus to 10%, increased singularity radius by 50%, increased post-singularity slam damage by 170%.

Jabber Sidekick - Increased movement speed bonus to 10% (all Jabber pets), increased Jabber's pistol damage by 20%.

Beefcake Jabber - Increased health bonus to 15%, increased attack command damage by 300%, increased Beefcake's shotgun damage by 33%.

Gunslinger Jabber - Increased critical damage bonus to 10%, increased Gunslinger's SMG damage by 15%.

ION Loader - Fixed the pet bonus not getting boosted by Barbaric Yawp.

BUL Loader - Fixed the pet bonus not getting boosted by Barbaric Yawp, added Elemental Resistance.

WAR Loader - Fixed the pet bonus not getting boosted by Barbaric Yawp, added Elemental Resistance, replaced fire rate bonus with shield damage.



Amara

Fist of the Elements
-------------
Anima - Updated description to mention that it does not work with the Cold Hearted augment.

Steady Hands - No change.

Infusion - No change.

Tempest - Fixed the Shock Damage being boosted less than it says it should.

Illuminated Fist - No change.

Wildfire - Increased spread chance to 10% per point.

Dread - No change.

Indiscriminate - No change.

Deep Well - Fixed it not giving the correct amount of heat reduction for CoV weapons.

Catharsis - Damage multiplied by 5, cooldown removed.

Sustainment - Lowered lifesteal to 0.2% per point and changed the description to be more accurate.

Conflux - No change.

Forceful Expression - No change.

Mystical Assault
-------------
Do Harm - No change.

Fast Hand(s) - No change.

Violent Tapestry - No change.

Alacrity - No change.

Transcend - No change.

Restless - Increased cooldown bonus to 6% per point.

Ascendant - No change.

From Rest - No change.

Laid Bare - Increased damage bonus to 10% per point.

Wrath - Increased damage bonuses to 8.33% each per point

Remnant - No change.

Awakening - No change.

Avatar - No change.

Brawl
-------------
Root to Rise - No change.

Personal Space - Made it also affect Melee damage and Phaseslam damage.

Clarity - No change.

Arms Deal - No change.

Samsara - Fixed the health regeneration being based on missing health.

Helping Hand(s) - No change.

Mindfulness - Replaced the Shield Recharge Delay with 0.5% Damage Resistance per point.

 ┗----Rationale: There are two primary reasons to use Mindfulness, and neither of them especially benefit from less recharge delay; going super speed with a Driver for damage (meaning you're constantly hurting yourself), or using it as a gap-closer in a Melee build (in which case lower delay actually hampers Roid shields). A small amount of damage resistance per stack is beneficial to both styles of play instead of slightly aiding one and hampering another.

Find Your Center - No change.

Vigor - Increase movement speed bonus to 5% per point.

One With Nature - No change.

Do unto Others - Reduced cooldown to 3 seconds, increased damage by 33%.

Jab Cross - No change.

Guardian Angel - No change.

Blitz - Reduced cooldown to 6 seconds.

Enlightened Force
-------------
Trust in Yourself - No change.

No Mistakes In Nature - No change.

Heavy Rain - No change.

Go With The Flow - No change.

Unweave the Rainbow - No change.

Ebb and Flow - No change.

Combo Breaker - No change.

Joyful Freedom - No change.

Burn Both Ends - Increased stack duration to ten seconds, updated description to mention that it only affects kinetic and elemental damage.

Body and Mind - Reduced the damage by 50%, doubled the nova radius.

 ┗----Rationale: Ideally this skill would have a timer on it limiting the amount of times it can trigger within a certain period of time, but the next best thing that can be done to limit the apocalyptic synergy with the Face-puncher is to chop the damage down a chunk. The radius has been boosted as some sort of compensation for melee builds to be able to damage enemies further away from your initial target for a little more crowd-damage.

Free the Soul - No change.

Atman - No change.

Clear the Mind - No change.


Action Skills/Augments
----------------------
One of Amara's bigger issues is a reliance on her Action Skills but lacking the cooldown to use them frequently without the use of things such as Expedite or Topped Off. Since Topped Off has been nerfed and having viable options other than Expedite is a good thing (especially if you lack the Designer's Cut DLC), most of her Action Skills have received a substantial reduction in cooldown length.

Phaseslam - Increased damage by 42%, lowered cooldown to 24 seconds. Added a note to the skill description mentioning that Splash bonuses apply to this action skill and its augments.

Fracture - Increased damage by 92%, lowered cooldown to 26 seconds.

Downfall - Made Downfall's slam damage and radius the same as a standard Phaseslam, increased the damage of the beam 1000%, lowered cooldown to 28 seconds.

Revelation - Removed damage penalty, increased damage 150%.

Glamour - Removed damage/action skill cooldown penalties.

Phasecast - Increased damage by 16%, lowered cooldown to 18 seconds.

Deliverance - Projectile damage increased by 300%, cooldown lowered to 20 seconds.

Reverbration - Damage reduced by 50% (damage on the skill card does not match actual damage, deals roughly the same damage as standard Phasecast on initial hit now), lowered cooldown to 22 seconds.

Tandava - Damage increased by 77%, cooldown lowered to 24 seconds.

Soul Sap - Reduced lifesteal to 15%, reduce Ascendant bonus to 5%.

Stillness of Mind - Removed damage/action skill cooldown penalties

The Eternal Fist - Lowered cooldown to 16 seconds.

Ties that Bind - No change.

Fist over Matter - Fist damage increased by 200%, cooldown lowered to 14 seconds.

Light Fantastic - Lowered cooldown to 34 seconds.
