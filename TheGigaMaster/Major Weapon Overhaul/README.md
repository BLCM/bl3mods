# Weapon Overhaul Mod

## TLDR

Almost all legendary/unique weapons are buffed and some are nerfed to balance out damage across the board.

The motto I use is "Start low and go slow", so most guns only have a minor increase to damage to start. This will change as I get feedback, which is critical to balance; Please give any and all feedback,no matter how trivial it may feel!

For a full list of changes, see the link below.

## Description

Balance is defined as "stability produced by even distribution of weight on each side of the vertical axis".

In BL3, the goal of balance is to make items feel like they are on an average playing field with each other, but we all know such is not the case. Some guns simply outclass others without even trying. Think of the OPQ System: Even underleveld, it's still among the best of the best.  When making changes, the idea of buffing/nerfing items is to buff items to match the DPS expected at higher levels rather than nerf overpowered items to the ground (unless its obviously broken IE free radical). Items should feel like close to each other in terms of damage and effectiveness; The player should have choice rather than be forced into specific gear setups because it is the only thing that works. 

The problem I have with the current state of balance is that nobody likes useless legendary items. I personally hate throwing away a large number of weapons. It irks me. This mod changes the damage values of a large number of weapons (almost all legendary/unique/red text weapons), as many feel unusable after a certain point.

This WILL affect game balance significantly, but will also make previously useless weapons feel good and takedown weapons feel powerful, like they are a weapon that should be used and not browsed over.

You can find a table with the values I'm adjusting below:

This mod is very much so a WIP, so thing's will NOT be completely balanced. I created the values based on how they feel/feedback I get from people. Any and all feedback is appreciated, as it'll allow me to better balance weapons out. After all, we don't want to end up with another Free Radical. The power-creep shall be no more!

If anything feels broken/OP or underpowered, please contact me on Discord. I really need feedback to really nail down the balance.

# Changelog

To find what weapons are buffed/nerfed, please refer to the spreadsheet above (also WIP). See the individual tab you want for a specific weapon (IE Base Pistol DMG). Weapons in yellow are currently not working and I need to rework. 

Items highlighted in green are buffed, and red are nerfed. I'll be working on creating a sheet which just lists all the item buffs/nerfs in a simple easy to read format. However, that's a later thing, as I'm still laying the groundwork for the mod and adding items, then I will work on balance and fine tuning.

#

0.1.8.1 - Added and balanced Guardian Takedown Weapons with red text changes included. These guns should feel considerably more powerful compared to the base game stats they have.

0.1.8 - Re-balanced base game snipers.

0.1.7 - Balanced base game shotguns. Only 1 isn't working (the redline).

0.1.6 - Balanced base game assault rifles. Some don't work and are noted in the mod and the spreadsheet. I will come back to these. For now, I'm going to continue to lay the groundwork for all guns.

0.1.5 - Completely rebalanced all pistols and SMG's. Buff values can be found on the spreadsheet in the corresponding sheet (ie Base SMG DMG or Base Pistol DMG)

0.1.3 - Balanced Atlas, COV and Dahl pistols. Dahl AAA doesn't work currently.

0.1.2 - Balanced sniper damage values to be positive

0.1.1 - Added shotguns and snipers.

0.1.0 - First unofficial release. Includes changes to legendary base game pistols, SMG's, and AR's. This is designed to lay the foundation/groundwork of how this mod will be made. Values will NOT be balanced very well, if at all.

# To Do

## Ideas/Considerations

- Create a sense of weapon progression, where not everything is good at MH 10, but have some items be good early game, some be good early MH levels, and some good at MH 10/11. Not everything should be MH 10 viable, but you can take something that isn't good and with enough work, make it MH 10 viable.  
  - This is later down the line once I have finished adding all weapons to the mod.
- Fine tune weapons prn

ONE FINAL NOTE

First off, if you've read this far, I'm suprised. Most people have the patients of a goldfish.

I will get to the DLC's in due time. Please don't come yelling at me about stuff like "MuH FAvoRItE gUN iSN't GoOd yEt" or "YoU RUinEd tHE gAMe" - This is a personal project that rapidly evolved and now I'm doing a game overhaul. I got sick of a lot of items not being viable so I said "I can fix that". And now we're here. I appreciate anyone and everyone who plays/uses this mod, as I've spent multiple hours (15+ now) creating and fine tuning this.

Enjoy the mod! - TheGigaMaster
