True Trials
==============

I heard you like raid bosses? This mod compiles the True Trials Weekly
events into 1 mod so you can play every trial like a true trial.
Basically copies Gearbox's loot. Weakens the Hag slightly. Borrowing
from Gearboxes Weekly Events, RAID-IFY all the trials, and also
restore both the weekly event drops and the original drops. It also
changes Trial Names using DexManly's code.

When I read Gearbox's hotfixes they raidified the trial bosses exactly
how I'd do em too.

* Tough Trial bosses
* Great trial boss chests
* Trial bosses drop both dedicated Class Mods and Weekly event loot
