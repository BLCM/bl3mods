Thank you fellow Vault Hunter for downloading the Borderlands 3 Radiance Mod!

This is a standalone .hotfix mod intended to rework and rebalance the game. Most of the values are taken from other hotfix mods, but there are new custom values for players to have fun and enjoy the experience with. The people below helped the most with making this mod happen!

Thanks to CodyCode, SsPyR, Apocalyptech, 10 FPS, Apple1417, Grimm, and Aaron0000.

DISCLAIMER:

1. Please do not load it with any other mods. Doing so may cause crashes, changes not working, or save file corruption. I am not responsible for anything that happens to your game in any of those cases, so please make sure you stick to the rule book.

2. If you are a STREAMER, please DISABLE your Echo Cast events to avoid sharing ANY modded/event gear to viewers. 

3. If you encounter ANY bugs or scaling issues, PLEASE test extensively to ensure that when you finally do forward the report to me.

You can submit any reports to me via Discord @ RadiantArin#7156

Thank you so much for downloading, and enjoy, fellow badass!

CHANGELOG:

• Boss enemies for a limited time will do more damage and are a lot more beefy.

• Weapon balancing and rebalancing.

• New shields, weapons, and items!
