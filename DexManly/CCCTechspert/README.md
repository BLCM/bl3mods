Calm Cool Collected Techspert (Zane classmod)
===================

This mod replaces Really Expensive Jacket with Calm Cool Collected on the Techspert class mod. 
The com will only be able to spawn with +1 in the skill and when the mod isn't loaded you will 
have ReallyExpensiveJacket instead. If are already have CCC, the health regen shows as +6% instead
of +3%.

I dont think anyone has ever been excited to use the techspert and I felt that CCC is such a unique
and powerful skill. Maybe this will draw some people in to some different buid diversity. Zane has
some real competitive coms now...sorry critical mass...not you
