### This mod replaces Really Expensive Jacket with Calm Cool Collected on the Techspert class mod. 
### The com will only be able to spawn with +1 in the skill and when the mod isn't loaded you will 
### have ReallyExpensiveJacket instead. If are already have CCC, the health regen shows as +6% instead
### of +3%.
###
### I dont think anyone has ever been excited to use the techspert and I felt that CCC is such a unique
### and powerful skill. Maybe this will draw some people in to some different buid diversity. Zane has
### some real competitive coms now...sorry critical mass...not you
###
### Special thanks to Grimm for the help on this one.
