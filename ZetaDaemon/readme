-Soleki Orion
Transforms the Soleki Protocol sniper into a recreation of the Orion from BL1. 
Has increased stats over the Soleki to make it a stronger weapon, also now drops from Tumorhead in Lectra City on Promethea.

-MaggieTrickshotBalancing
Totally legit balancing of the Maggie and Trickshot to be equal.
