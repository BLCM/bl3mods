Mods by ZetaDaemon

-Soleki Orion
Transforms the Soleki Protocol sniper into a recreation of the Orion from BL1. 
Has increased stats over the Soleki to make it a stronger weapon, also now drops from Tumorhead in Lectra City on Promethea.

-MaggieTrickshotBalancing
Totally legit balancing of the Maggie and Trickshot to be equal.

-Bekah Buff
Increases the Bekah's damage by 40% to make it more viable in endgame play

-More Max Ammo
Greatly increase the ammount of ammo you can hold with the highest level SDU purchased

-Full Auto Anarchy
Makes the Anarchy full auto to save your finger from having to constantly spam click

-Orphan Maker
Recreates the BL2 Orphan Maker by replacing the One Pump Chump Shotgun. Has two pellets to match the non-vertical grip version of the Orphan Maker.
Doesn't have the self damage as I have no idea how to implement it and I dont even want to anyway.

-No Burst Plasma Coil
Removes the 16 round burst on the Plasma Coil but reduces the fire rate a fair bit to compensate for the constant firing without a delay.
Makes the Plasma Coil a bit more reliable and consistant to use in my opinion.

-Better Brainstormer
Gives a double damage boost to the brainstormer to make it have similar damage to the reflux as theyre basically the same gun

-Radiation Fire in the Skag Den (Nuclear Fallout)
Changes the bonus damage of Fire in the Skag Den to be radiation instead of fire
