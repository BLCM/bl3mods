Mods by ZetaDaemon

-Soleki Orion
Transforms the Soleki Protocol sniper into a recreation of the Orion from BL1. 
Has increased stats over the Soleki to make it a stronger weapon, also now drops from Tumorhead in Lectra City on Promethea.

-MaggieTrickshotBalancing
Totally legit balancing of the Maggie and Trickshot to be equal.

-Bekah Buff
Increases the Bekah's damage by 40% to make it more viable in endgame play

-More Max Ammo
Greatly increase the ammount of ammo you can hold with the highest level SDU purchased

-Full Auto Anarchy
Makes the Anarchy full auto to save your finger from having to constantly spam click

-Orphan Maker
Recreates the BL2 Orphan Maker by replacing the One Pump Chump Shotgun. Has two pellets to match the non-vertical grip version of the Orphan Maker.
Doesn't have the self damage as I have no idea how to implement it and I dont even want to anyway.

-No Burst Plasma Coil
Removes the 16 round burst on the Plasma Coil but reduces the fire rate a fair bit to compensate for the constant firing without a delay.
Makes the Plasma Coil a bit more reliable and consistant to use in my opinion.

-Better Brainstormer
Gives a double damage boost to the brainstormer to make it have similar damage to the reflux as theyre basically the same gun

-Radiation Fire in the Skag Den (Nuclear Fallout)
Changes the bonus damage of Fire in the Skag Den to be radiation instead of fire

-Stacking Rage And Recover
Lets Rage and Recover stack up to 5 times so that you almost always gain a new stack of the health regen after a kill rather than it just re-triggering the kill skill.
Adds a mention of the stacking on the description, also changes it to say 'Max Health/sec' rather than 'Missing Health/sec' as apparently thats what it should be.

-Drop fixes - Soulrender
Fixes the Soulrender not dropping from Tom and Xam, hopefully will be actually fixed by gearbox soon but I'm putting this up in the meantime.
Credit to Apple1417 for actually figuring out what went wrong and what needed fixing, I'm just putting it up for people to use :)
Also looking into the Juliets Dazzle but haven't gotten that one working yet
