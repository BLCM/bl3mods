# So this util relies on having a set of level-specific object dumps, of the sort
# generated by UUU, among other UE4 DLL-injected libraries:
# https://framedsc.github.io/GeneralGuides/universal_ue4_consoleunlocker.htm
#
# That's a *bit* overkill, but the advantage is that it's a pretty trivial way
# for me to tailor a set of level hotfixes without going too crazy with MatchAll.
# This alternative (but untested) implementation is theoretically all you'd need
# to do this mod using only JWP serializations:
#
#     data = BL3Data()
#     for spawnoption_name in data.find('', 'SpawnOptions_'):
#         if 'Enemies' in spawnoption_name:
#             spawnoption = data.get_exports(spawnoption_name, 'SpawnOptionData')[0]
#             for idx in range(len(spawnoption['Options'])):
#                 mod.reg_hotfix(Mod.EARLYLEVEL, 'MatchAll',
#                         spawnoption_name,
#                         'Options.Options[{}].Factory.Object..TeamOverride'.format(idx),
#                         team_to_set)
#
# ... that's it!  But you still end up with a mod file that's nearly 800KB (this
# one's 1.1MB, so not that much bigger), and you'd have nearly 3k MatchAll level
# statements.
#
# So in the end, I just kept this implementation, since I've got those object name
# dumps anyway.  Apologies to anyone else looking to re-generate this mod, though!

# TODO: It'd be trivial to adapt this to make all enemies totally friendly, but then
# I'd have to go through and make sure that any required-kill enemies *aren't*
# friendly, and that's more work than I care to do.
