Unlocked Vermivorous
====================

Ordinarily, Vermivorous only spawns during the Hemovorous fight when you're
in Mayhem 6 or higher.  This mod will make Vermivorous spawn during that
battle regardless of Mayhem level.

Note that this does *not* allow Vermivorous (or Hemovorous) to spawn outside
of their usual spot in Darkthirst Dominion.
