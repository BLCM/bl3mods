Various data-processing scripts, used to drive data generation for various
Google Sheets, my refs database, and a mod or two (before I started pulling
that into the mod-generation scripts themselves).

These scripts will invariably need access to the `bl3data` and/or
`bl3hotfixmod` libraries which up in the main `python_mod_helpers` folder
in this repo, so you'll have to symlink or copy them over in order to make
use of the scripts in here.
