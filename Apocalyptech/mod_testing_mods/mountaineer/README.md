Mountaineer
===========

Allows the player to walk up (nearly) vertical surfaces.  True 90-degree
walls (and overhangs) will generally still defeat the player, though the "step
height" which allows the player to climb stairs has also been increased by
about 10x, which will let you walk right on past many obstacles.  The step
height can be easily increased even further -- just edit the MaxStepHeight
values in the mod file.  Note that setting this value too high will probably
start to interfere with multi-level architecture with overhangs and the like.

Note that there are definitely circumstances where running into an object might
end up flinging you high into the air, so watch out for that.  It's also not
especially difficult to get yourself caught in inescapable "dead zones" of the
map, especially if you end up flying through the air, so watch out for that and
be prepared to do some fast travelling if necessary.

Also, alas, Gearbox does seem to like their invisible walls, so this might not
give you *quite* the freedom you were hoping for.
