No Cryo Penalty
===============

Gets rid of the movement penalty you'd otherwise suffer when a cryo
effect is applied to your character.  It also allows you to slide
while frozen.

This is obviously rather cheaty!  I'm using it myself just for
mod-testing purposes, but you do you.  :)

Changelog
=========

**v1.1.0** - Mar 19, 2021
 * Also allow sliding while frozen

**v1.0.0** - Mar 18, 2021
 * Initial release
