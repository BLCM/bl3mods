Droughts Chest Moves
====================

Moves white+red chests in The Droughts to right near the Highway FT.
Primarily just used for testing out my Red Chest Timer Reset and
Reopenable Gear Chests mods, but might also be useful to other folks
as an example of moving objects around a map.

This could pretty easily be expanded to move more than just white+red
chests, but until I have a desire to move around porta-potties and the
like, it'll remain just as it is.
