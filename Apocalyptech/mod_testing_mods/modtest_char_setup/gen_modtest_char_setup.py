# It looks like the "base" XP you get for discovering a zone is 268 or so.
# The default BaseValueConstant for this is 0.2, so I guess you'd get 53XP
# or so for discovering the first zone.  Presumably that 268 value goes up
# as you progress/level, so having this active on a levelled-up char will
# probably result in GR ridiculousness.
#
# Anyway, the XP numbers appear to be identical to BL2/TPS, so for level
# 53 we need to get at least 4,037,543 XP from the first zone discovery.
# 268*15100 = 4,046,800.  So that's what we'll use for now!
