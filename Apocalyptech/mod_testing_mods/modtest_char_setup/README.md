Modtest Char Setup
==================

Given the availability of save editors now, this one's not even really
much use to myself, but regardeless, it can be used to set up a mod-testing
char right at the beginning of the game.  Specifically, it does these things:

1. Alters the XP you get for discovering new areas of the game so that you
   jump straight to max level after Claptrap gets sucked up by the magnet,
   in Covenant Pass.
2. Alters the first gun chest to contain a Crader's EM-P5 and a Transformer
   shield, intended to be used with my two Super Buff mods.
3. Alters Covenant Pass's GameStage so that the SMG and Shield get spawned at
   max level.

Once you pick up your gear and get the XP right before the first battle,
quit the game, disable the mod, and head back in, and you'll have a max-level
char with max-level testing gear to play with.

As I say, with the advent of save editors, this isn't even really needed by
myself anymore, but I'm keeping it here for old time's sake.
