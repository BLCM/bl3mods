Super Buff: Crader's EM-P5
==========================

Cheat mod which gives Crader's EM-P5 the following:

* Absurd amount of damage
* Infinite ammo
* Perfect accuracy/handling
* Increased rate of fire

A level 1 EM-P5 will easily last you throughout an entire story
runthough, and probably into Mayhem levels after that.  This mod
also prevents Crader's EM-P5 from spawning with the x2 accessory,
though the infinite ammo capability should work fine regardless of
that part's presence.

This is basically just what I use for testing out mods, when I don't
want to be bothered by combat.  I'd picked Crader's EM-P5 originally
because it provided a nice movement speed increase, before I'd managed
to figure out doing a proper movement speed mod.  Obviously that's
less important to me now, since I have that available, but I've
kept using Crader's EM-P5 regardless.
