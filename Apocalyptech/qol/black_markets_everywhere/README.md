Black Markets Everywhere
========================

Sets all potential Black Market vending machine spawns to be active, and
removes their respawn timer (which ordinarily prevents it from respawning
for 30 minutes after being used).  Maps which can contain the machines
all have 2-3 spawn locations for the machine.

Maps which contain the machines:

* Ambermire
* Anvil
* Ascension Bluff
* Athenas
* Atlas HQ
* Blackbarrel Cellars
* Carnivora
* Cathedral of the Twin Gods
* Desolation's Edge
* Devil's Razor
* Droughts
* Floodmoor Basin
* Jakobs Estate
* Konrad's Hold
* Lectra City
* Meridian Metroplex
* Meridian Outskirts
* Neon Arterial
* Pyre of Stars
* Skywell-27
* Splinterlands
* Tazendeer Ruins
* Voracious Canopy
