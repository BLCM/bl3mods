Photo Mode Unlock
=================

Lets the camera in Photo Mode go extremely far, and also speeds it up
so that getting across the map isn't super slow.  Untested exactly
*how* far you can go -- you might not be able to go literally all the
way across every map, but you can at leaset go between the two Fast
Travels in The Droughts.

This also reduces the camera's collission radius to zero, which doesn't
let it clip directly through objects but it will often be able to slip
through seams if you're persistent enough, which will let you take the
camera under floors or through walls.
