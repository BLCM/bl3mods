=======================================

See the individual mod folders for full READMEs.

- **Always Visible Challenge Icons** - Makes challenge icons visible at all
  times (has various exceptions).
- **Atlas HQ Courtyard Shortcut** - Provides a way to climb up to the second
  level in the courtyard area, to avoid having to pointlessly run around the
  map just to get to the Atlas HQ building.
- **Atlas HQ Fast Travel** - A collection of mods to move the Atlas HQ Fast
  Travel machine to some more useful locations.
- **Beef Plissken Loot Pattern Fix** - Changes Beef Plissken's loot pattern to
  drop right around where he was, instead of potentially off the edge of the map.

  vending machine -- maps with the machine will have 2-3 available at all times.

  for killing enemies with specific manufacturers.

  Droughts have the usual porta-potty weapon attachments when looting.

  free, instead of costing 500 Eridium.
- **Mega TimeSaver XL** - Speeds up slow animations throughout the game.
- **More Visible ECHO Logs** - Makes the ECHO log loot bars (and, incidentally,
  mission items) far more visible
- **No Panting** - Disables the panting vocal loop that plays during sprinting.
- **No Reload Notification** - Removes the "reload" notification when you're
  near the end of a magazine.
