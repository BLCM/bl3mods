- **Always Visible Challenge Icons** - Makes challenge icons visible at all
  times (has various exceptions).

  map just to get to the Atlas HQ building.
- **Atlas HQ Fast Travel** - A collection of mods to move the Atlas HQ Fast
  Travel machine to some more useful locations.
- **Beef Plissken Loot Pattern Fix** - Changes Beef Plissken's loot pattern to
  drop right around where he was, instead of potentially off the edge of the map.

  free, instead of costing 500 Eridium.
- **Mega TimeSaver XL** - Speeds up slow animations throughout the game.
- **More Visible ECHO Logs** - Makes the ECHO log loot bars (and, incidentally,
  mission items) far more visible
