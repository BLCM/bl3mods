Atlas HQ Courtyard Shortcut
===========================

Adds a single umbrella'd food cart just to the right as you exit the
bank area at the beginning of Atlas HQ, as you head out into the
promenade/courtyard.  Left there by a panicked merchant eager to
reach the Fast Travel, to flee the Maliwan assault on Promethea?
Perhaps, but their loss is your gain -- the cart is sufficiently
tall to allow you to climb up onto the promenade level right
away!

Obviously this would allow for some sequence breaking when playing
through the plot, and I have no idea how that ends up interacting
with the plot sequence.  This mod's intended for after Atlas HQ's
plot has been finished, so that future visits to farm the Power
Troopers or Katagawa Jr. don't require so much pointless running
around.
