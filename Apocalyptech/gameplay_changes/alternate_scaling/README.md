Alternate Scaling
=================

This is a collection of mods which set the main "universal" scaling constant
to match either BL1, BL2, or TPS (depending on which you choose).

The default scaling factors for the various Borderlands games are:

* **BL1**: `1.045` or thereabouts, though BL1 doesn't have a single scaling
  factor, so it's more difficult to reduce it to a single number.
* **BL2**: `1.13`
* **TPS**: `1.1`
* **BL3**: `1.09`

Note that these scaling values interact oddly with Mayhem Mode, and values
above `1.09` actually make Mayhem levels *easier* due to how the math works
out.  Use a lower scaling value if you want harder Mayhem play.
