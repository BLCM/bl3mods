Unlock DLC3 Tech
================

This mod unlocks Coresploders, Traitorweed, and Telezappers right from
the beginning, in Bounty of Blood.  The mod doens't bother touching
Breezebloom, since you get that almost immediately anyway.

This also does not affect mission-specific objects, such as the first
Coresploder you use to rescue Titus, or the Telezapper that Juno
unlocks for you as part of the story.
