Expanded Legendary Pools
========================

Borderlands 3 already has a pretty wide world-drop pool, but this mod makes it
even bigger.  It adds all legendary/unique items into the main world-drop
legendary pools (basically anything with red text).  This currently includes
all items from:

* Bloody Harvest
* Broken Hearts
* Revenge of the Cartels
* Maliwan Takedown
* Mayhem 4 items (which will drop regardless of Mayhem level, even in normal)
* Mayhem 2.0 items (which will drop regardless of Mayhem level, even in normal)
* Guardian Takedown
* DLC1 (Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot)
* DLC2 (Guns, Love, and Tentacles)
* DLC3 (Bounty of Blood)
* DLC4 (Psycho Krieg and the Fantastic Fustercluck)
* DLC5 (Designer's Cut)
* DLC6 (Director's Cut) and Vault Card #1
* Vault Card #2
* Vault Card #3

This mod is more or less intended to be used with something like Better Loot,
though players in Mayhem 10 who get lots of legendary drops from there will
benefit as well.  I recommend using this with my Uniques Are Legendary mod,
which will make the red-text purple gear more noticeable when they drop.
This also pairs nicely with my Boss Drop Randomizer, Mission Reward Randomizer,
and DLC Loot De-Emphasizer mods.

**Notes on Mod Compatibility:**

If using this mod alongside the Provocateur COM mod, make sure this mod appears
in your mod list *before* the Provocateur COM mod, so that Provocateur gets
added into the loot pool properly.

Changelog
=========

**v1.6.1** - Nov 16, 2022
 * Players using this mod in Normal, in the early game, without also running
   Early Bloomer, were getting various legendary DLC artifacts as drops
   (specifically Lunacy, Mysterious Artifact, Pearl of Ineffable Knowledge,
   and Vendetta).  The problem wouldn't show up in TVHM or with Mayhem Mode
   enabled, or with the Early Bloomer mod enabled.  Regardless, fixed that
   up!
