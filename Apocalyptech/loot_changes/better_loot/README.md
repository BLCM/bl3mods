Better Loot
===========

Borderlands 3 honestly didn't really *need* a Better Loot mod, but here it
is anyway!  Like its BL2 and TPS counterparts, this mod does a number of
different things:

* Sets the rarity weights to be improved, globally
* Increases Eridium drop rates and quantities.
* Guarantees specific legendary drops from nearly all the bosses which
  have unique drops.  This has been updated through DLC6 (Director's Cut).
* Unlocks Mayhem 4/Mayhem 6 drops for the named enemies as well.  Not sure if this
  unlocks world Mayhem 4 drops or not, but you can use my Expanded Legendary Pools
  mod for that.
* Guarantees anointments on all gear which supports anointments
* Improves a few specific containers:
  * The start-game Porta Potties in The Droughts will now have the usual Porta
    Potty loot.
  * Ava's chest in Invasion of Privacy will always have a legendary item in the
    second slot.
  * Prisa's pop's stash at the end of Get Quick, Slick will have one guaranteed
    legendary.
  * The Jakobs chests in Knotty Peak (when you first meet Wainwright) will only
    contain Jakobs gear, and be at least blue rarity.
  * All Eridian ammo chests in Vault of the Serpent (in Tazendeer -- the vault
    which Typhon and Leda opened) will contain only Eridium.

Like the BL2+TPS versions of Better Loot, bosses which have more than one drop
assigned to them will drop from the pool that many times.  For instance, the Skrakk
is set to drop either Skeksil or an Infiltrator COM.  With Better Loot, it'll have
a guaranteed drop from that pool *twice* - you might get two Skeksils, two Infiltrators,
or one of each.  Some bosses with huge loot pools have been limited somewhat with
this.

Note that Mayhem levels increase drop quality as well, and a vanilla Mayhem 10
already drops extremely good gear.  I personally use my No Mayhem Drop Scaling mod
to remove those inbuilt buffs to drops, so that the quality of drops is the same
regardless of whether you're in Normal, TVHM, or any Mayhem mode.

I personally recommend the use of Expanded Legendary Pools with this mod, so that
the loot you come across is as varied as possible.

For a list of what drops you should expect from bosses, while using this mod, see
[expected_drops.md](https://github.com/BLCM/bl3mods/blob/master/Apocalyptech/loot_changes/better_loot/expected_drops.md).

Note that this mod leaves Arms Race (DLC5, Stormblind Complex) basically as-is,
since the rarity levels in there are pretty clearly engineered for specific
effect.  This mod *does* increase the odds of legendary gear in the area-event
reward chests, though, and increases the drop quantity for Heavyweight Harker.

**Mod Compatibility Info:**

If you use Boss Drop Randomizer along with this mod, make sure this mod is
*before* Boss Drop Randomzer in your mod list.

This mod includes the functionality in my "Unlock Mayhem-Specific Drops" mod,
so there's no reason to use both together (though it shouldn't hurt anything
if you do).

This mod also includes the functionality of my "Droughts Stocked Porta-Potties"
mod, so there's no reason to use both together (though it shouldn't hurt
anything if you do).

Changelog
=========

**v1.3.4** - Jul 2, 2021
 * Fixed guaranteed drops for Muldock, the Anointed (and possibly also Artemis,
   Mincemeat, and the runnable version of Private Beans, though I didn't
   verify if those were broken).
 * Updated "expected drops" list to include event cosmetics, for Captain Haunt
   and Joey Ultraviolet.

Jun 16, 2021 *(no version number change)*
 * Added contact info to mod header

**v1.3.3** - May 3, 2021
 * Guaranteed boss drop when you kill Ipswitch Dunne's Saurian (we had an
   invalid object path for that, previously)

**v1.3.2** - Apr 23, 2021
 * Updated with extra drop sources added in GBX's 2021-04-22 hotfix (for DLC2
   enemies)
   * Put in fixes for two GBX additions which are still currently broken,
     namely: adding Insider to Tom/Xam, and adding Sapper COM to Empowered
     Grawn
 * Fixed some edge cases with Gmork drops, and added the standard "Badass"
   pool list to Gmork's drops, to match the other Hunt creatures in DLC2.

**v1.3.1** - Apr 13, 2021
 * Added DLC6 enemies to the improved Eridium drop sections.

**v1.3.0** - Apr 13, 2021
 * Updated with DLC6 (Director's Cut) enemies.
 * Buffed up non-unique loot drops for Hemovorous the Invincible and The Seer
 * Some tweaks/improvements to a few "special" chests throughout the game:
   * Incorporated Droughts Stocked Porta-Potties mod, to make all porta-potties
     in The Droughts have standard loot definitions.
   * Ava's chest in Invasion of Privacy will always have a legendary item in the
     second slot.
   * Prisa's pop's stash at the end of Get Quick, Slick will have one guaranteed
     legendary.
   * Set the two chests in Knotty Peak (when you first meet Wainwright) to be
     at least blue-quality Jakobs gear.
   * All Eridian ammo chests in Vault of the Serpent (in Tazendeer) will contain
     only Eridium.

**v1.2.2** - Mar 11, 2021
 * Updated to include loot changes with today's hotfixes, namely moving
   the Firestorm grenade drop from Captain Traunt to Aurelia.  The new
   R.Y.N.A.H.  drop added to "Loot" type enemies drops at 13%, which seems
   reasonable, so I left that as-is.
 * Also fixed a bug in GBX's Firestorm hotfix which removed Aurelia's
   Juliet's Dazzle drop, though hopefully GBX fixes that up themselves soon.

**v1.2.1** - Nov 12, 2020
 * Doubled chances of legendary gear from Arms Race area-event reward
   chests.

**v1.2.0** - Nov 12, 2020
 * Updated with Heavyweight Harker from DLC5.  This was already a
   guaranteed drop, but it's a wide pool, so increased the quantity
   a bit.

**v1.1.0** - Oct 3, 2020
 * Updated with DLC4 enemies

**v1.0.0** - Sep 26, 2020
 * First versioned release
