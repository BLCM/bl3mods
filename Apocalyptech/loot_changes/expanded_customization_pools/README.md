Expanded Customization Pools
============================

Expands the world drop customization pool, and flattens the pool out, so each
customization is as likely to drop as any other.  It also increases the
customization drop rate, though that can be overridden with my Customization
Drop Rate (make sure to include that *after* this mod, if you're using both).

There are a few versions of this mod, depending on what you want.  All versions
omit the customziations you get from preorders, deluxe editions, and paid DLC,
since those customizations aren't at all useful as drops (if you own the DLC,
you already have them, and if you don't own the DLC, the dropped cosmetics can't
be redeemed).  The variants:

* **All** - Apart from the exceptions above, all customizations will world drop.
* **No Mission Rewards** - Excludes the customizations you'd get as mission rewards
* **No Mission Rewards or Earl** - Excludes the mission reward customizations, and
  all the ones that you can otherwise buy at Earl's shop in Sanctuary.
* **No Mission Rewards, Earl, or Vault Cards** - Excludes the mission reward
  customizations, the ones found inside Vault Cards, and all the ones that you can
  otherwise buy at Earl's shop in Sanctuary.

Note that DLC cosmetics that you get via missions might still need some tweaking
to get excluded properly from the above variants.  Also note that slot machine
rewards are completely untouched here, so the slots will still just continue
dropping from their vanilla pool.

TODO
====

- DLC Cosmetics could use some going-over, to see if they need to be excluded from
  the "No Mission Rewards" variants.
- This doesn't actually touch emotes at all, which don't ordinarily world-drop.
  Perhaps we should add those in?  Still, the only ones which are "random" in a sense
  are the Vault Card ones, so it might not be worth it.
