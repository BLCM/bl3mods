Red Chest Timer Reset
=====================

Prevents the game's red chests from remembering their opened state when
quitting and restarting the game.  They will still have their usual timers
while staying within the same game session, but a trip to the main menu
will now let them be re-opened right away.

This does *not* affect explicitly single-use chests, such as the one in
Lilith's quarters.  Those chests will continue to be only usable once per
game.

**Note:** Any red chest timer information currently stored in your savegame
will still apply when you go into the game, even with this mod active.
You can either wait for those timers to expire as usual, or just quit out
to the main menu once to clear it out.

**Mod Compatibility Info:** My Reopenable Gear Chests mod is a more powerful
version of this mod, which makes the game forget about the opened state
entirely inbetween level loads, rather than just preventing that info from
being saved into the savegame.  There's no *problem* with having both mods
enabled at the same time, but this one is a bit pointless if you're also
running Reopenable Gear Chests.
