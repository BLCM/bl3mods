Customization Drop Rate
=======================

This is a collection of mods which lets you determine how often cosmetic items
will drop from the game.  They could be useful both to folks looking to acquire
all cosmetic items, or to turn off cosmetic drops entirely, if you've already
collected the lot.

The default drop rate for cosmetics in the game is `0.5%` (though it's higher in
the DLCs, typically).  The four variants available here are:

- **None** - `0%`
- **Improved** - `3%`
- **Frequent** - `6%`
- **Constant** - `12%`

Given the volume of cosmetics, even at 12% it'll probably still take you ages to
collect them all.

By and large, these do *not* make changes to the cosmetics frequency inside
chests, though the `none` variant does attempt to remove them from those as well.
Note too that *dedicated* cosmetic drops, such as from named bosses (mostly in
DLCs), are unaffected, so you'll still see those.

I'd recommend using this along with my Expanded Customization Pools mod, to
increase the variety of cosmetics which are world-droppable.

Note that if you *are* looking to unlock all cosmetics, that can be done quite
easily with any of a variety of BL3 profile editors now available, so if you
don't care about overt cheating, that'd be the quicker option.
