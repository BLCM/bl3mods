No Wasted Equipment
===================

This mod makes it so that character-specific attributes will only ever spawn in a version
which is useful to a player currently in the game.  This applies to COMs, Customizations,
and Anointments on gear.

For playing singleplayer, this means that if you're a Siren, you'll only ever see drops
for Siren COMs, Siren Skins/Heads, an Siren-specific anointments (you *will* still see
"generic" anointments, of course, just not gunner/operative/beastmaster ones).

This *should* adjust itself automatically whenever players enter/leave a co-op session,
though that is currently untested by myself.

**Note:** This does *not* apply to situations where a boss (or boss-like enemy) has a
specific legendary COM drop.  For instance, the Hag of Fervor will continue to drop
Zane's Shockerator COM.  My Boss Drop Randomizer mod would take care of those instances,
but of course that also affects all other boss drops, so possibly not what you want.
