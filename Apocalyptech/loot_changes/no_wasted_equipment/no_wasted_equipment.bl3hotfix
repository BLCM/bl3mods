### Adjusts the character-specific weighting so that you won't get COMs,
### customizations, or anointments for any character other than the one
### you're currently playing.  Theoretically this should work just fine
### in multiplayer, though I haven't tested it at all in that mode.
###
### This does *not* affect specific gear drops from named enemies/bosses!

# Yep, this single statement should do it!  Rather nicer than the BL2/TPS versions.
# Default weighting: 0.15 (the character Atts add 0.85 when the char is present)
