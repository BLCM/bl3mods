Fix Broken Loot Patterns
========================

A few enemies in the game drop at least part of their loot in a single
tight point, making it impossible to sort through without picking some
of it up first.  This mod fixes up those few cases so that the loot
gets spread out in a more pleasing manner.

Specifically, the mod fixes up the pattern for:
* Mouthpiece
* Captain Traunt
* Loot Skrit / Loot Skritaari

This functionality is included in Better Loot as of v1.3.6, so there's
no need to use this mod if you've got an up-to-date Better Loot.  (It
won't hurt anything to have both enabled, though.)

Changelog
=========

**v1.0.0** - Jan 25, 2023
