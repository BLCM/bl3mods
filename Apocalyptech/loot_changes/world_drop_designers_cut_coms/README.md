World Drop Designer's Cut COMs
==============================

The Designer's Cut DLC (DLC5/Ixora) added in a fourth skill tree, but despite
having some common-rarity COMs to go along with the new skill tree, didn't
actually set them to drop anywhere in the game, apart from the specific new
legendary COMs.  This mod adds in those cut white/green/blue/purple COMs
into the main game's drop pool, so you'll be able to make use of COMs for
the fourth skill tree without having to farm for legendaries in Arms Race.

The COM names are:

* **Beastmaster:** Hellhound
* **Gunner:** Guzzler
* **Operative:** Bulldog
* **Siren:** Ascetic

They can drop in white, green, blue, or purple rarities, and can have the
same ability statistics as regular COMs.

Note that this mod does *not* add the Designer's Cut Legendary COMs to the
main world-drop COM pools -- for that, use my Expanded Legendary Pools mod.

**Notes on Mod Compatibility:**

If using this mod along with Fix Siren COM Blank Parts, make sure that this
mod is *after* Fix Siren COM Blank Parts in your modlist.  This mod applies
the Siren COM part fixes for the Balances that it touches, and if Fix Siren
COM Blank Parts happens after this one, it'll end up disabling the wrong part.
