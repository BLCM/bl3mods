====================================

See the individual mod folders for full READMEs.

- **Better Loot** - Improve the quality of loot, and set guaranteed drops for bosses.
- **Black Market World Drops** - Makes the Black Market vending machines use the world
  drop legendary pools.
- **Boss Drop Randomizer** - Randomizes drops from bosses
- **Customization Drop Rate** - A set of mods to change the drop rates for customizations,

- **Cusomizations: Only Heads and Skins** - Only drop heads+skin cosmetics, not any of
  the other sorts.
- **DLC Loot De-Emphasizer** - Flattens out the DLC enemy loot pools so they drop the same

- **Early Bloomer**- Unlock all weapon types, elements, manufacturers,
  anointments, etc, from the very beginning of the game.

  cosmetic items.
- **Expanded Legendary Pools** - Adds all legendary/unique items to the world drop pools.
- **First Gun Chest** - Some alternate contents for the first gun chest, in Covenant Pass.

- **Manufacturer Lock** - A set of mods which make only the specified manufacturers drop.
- **Mission Reward Randomizer** - Randomizes mission rewards

- **Only Atlas Grenades** - Non-legendary/unique grenades will always be Atlas.
- **Red Chest Timer Reset** - Prevents red chests from saving their open state to the
  savegame, so they can be re-opened more quickly.
- **Reopenable Gear Chests** - Removes the unlock timer from all red and white chests in the
  game, so they can be re-opened after switching maps.
- **Unlock Mayhem-Specific Drops** - Removes the Mayhem level restriction for drops which
  ordinarily require Mayhem 4 or Mayhem 6.
