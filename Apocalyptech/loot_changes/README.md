====================================

See the individual mod folders for full READMEs.

- **Better Loot** - Improve the quality of loot, and set guaranteed drops for bosses.
- **Black Market World Drops** - Makes the Black Market vending machines use the world
  drop legendary pools.
- **Boss Drop Randomizer** - Randomizes drops from bosses
- **Customization Drop Rate** - A set of mods to change the drop rates for customizations,
  from none at all, to much more than usual.
- **Cusomizations: Only Heads and Skins** - Only drop heads+skin cosmetics, not any of
  the other sorts.
- **DLC Loot De-Emphasizer** - Flattens out the DLC enemy loot pools so they drop the same
  as base-game enemies.
- **Early Bloomer**- Unlock all weapon types, elements, manufacturers,
  anointments, etc, from the very beginning of the game.
- **Enable Pendant of Terramorphous Artifact** - This was an unfinished artifact cut from
  the game before launch.  This mod re-enables it and fixes its most glaring issue.

  cosmetic items.
- **Expanded Legendary Pools** - Adds all legendary/unique items to the world drop pools.
- **First Gun Chest** - Some alternate contents for the first gun chest, in Covenant Pass.

- **Mission Reward Randomizer** - Randomizes mission rewards
- **More Elemental Weapons** - Increases the probability of rolling the elemental version
  of any given weapon.
- **More Tracker Darts** - Increases the probability of having the Tracker Dart mechanism
  on Atlas weapons.

  match the player(s) currently in the game.
- **Only Atlas Grenades** - Non-legendary/unique grenades will always be Atlas.
- **Red Chest Timer Reset** - Prevents red chests from saving their open state to the
  savegame, so they can be re-opened more quickly.
- **Reopenable Gear Chests** - Removes the unlock timer from all red and white chests in the
  game, so they can be re-opened after switching maps.
- **Unlock Mayhem-Specific Drops** - Removes the Mayhem level restriction for drops which
  ordinarily require Mayhem 4 or Mayhem 6.
- **World Drop Designer's Cut COMs** - Adds some ordinarily non-droppable non-legendary
  COMs from the Designer's Cut DLC into the world drop pools.
