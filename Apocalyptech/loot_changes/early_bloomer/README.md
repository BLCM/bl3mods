Early Bloomer
=============

Unlocks all weapon types, elements, manufacturers, anointments, etc, from the very
beginning of the game, in addition to unlocking all available inventory slots.

This mod also allows use of the Eridian Resonator from the beginning of the game
(the device that lets you harvest Eridium clusters).  It does *not* unlock the
Analyzer, which translates the Eridian messages -- I wasn't able to figure out
how to do that one via mods.  The Analyzer can be unlocked with savegame
editing, though.

The first few chests encountered in Covenant Pass are still locked to providing
pistols-only, but you'll start seeing the full variety of in-game pistols even
from that point.  The mod also removes the level-locking of the Polyaimorous,
Wedding Invitation, and Superstreamer -- to make use of those, you'd likely
need to be using my Expanded Legendary Pools mod.

**Compatibility Info:**

If you're running any mods which *remove* Anointments from the game, such as
Grimm's "Mayhem," or the forthcoming overhaul by SSpyR, this mod will end up
re-enabling them due to how these unlocks work.  You can use the two at the same
time without problems, but make sure that this mod loads *before* any mod which
disables Anointments, so that the Anointment-disabling statements are the ones
which happen *after* this mod.
