DLC Loot De-Emphasizer
======================

So far, all Borderlands 3 DLCs (through DLC5, Designer's Cut) have had the
in-DLC enemies drop at increased rates from DLC-specific loot pools, so that
when you go through the DLC, you're very likely to acquire the gear that was
added with the DLC.  That's certainly nice the first time through, but I found
I wanted their drops in subsequent plays to just match all other world drops
from base game enemies.  That's what this mod does!

This mod is definitely intended to be used alongside my Expanded Legendary Pools
mod, which adds all DLC gear into the world drop pools.

**Note about Arms Race / Heavyweight Harker:**

Due to how the Arms Race / DLC5 loot pools are set up, and how Heavyweight
Harker's drops are set up, this mod ends up effectively randomizing Heavyweight
Harker's unique drops as well.  For now that's just an unavoidable side effect
of this, alas!  I may be able to figure out a way around that at a later date.

**Note about Purple Skill Tree COMs and Director's Cut:**

DLC6 (Director's Cut) adds in drops for the non-legendary Purple Tree COMs
which were added to the data in DLC5 (Designer's Cut), for DLC6 enemies.  This
mod will remove those drops -- I highly recommend using my "World Drop Designer's
Cut COMs" mod to put those mods into the global world drop pool instead, which
allows them to drop from any source which drops COMs.

**Notes on Mod Compatibility:**

If using this mod alongside the Provocateur COM mod, make sure that this mod
appears in your mod list *after* the Provocateur COM mod, so that Provocateur
gets properly de-emphasized.  Note that when using both together, you'll need
to be using something like Expanded Legendary Pools, in order to get any
Provocateur drops.
