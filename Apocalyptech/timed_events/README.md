Apocalyptech's Timed Event-Related BL3 Mods
===========================================

See the individual mod folders for full READMEs.

- **All Event Spawns Active** - Turns on Bloody Harvest, Broken Hearts,
  and Revenge of the Cartels spawn alterations (does not actually enable
  the events themselves)
- **Event Rewards** - A collection of mods to set the Seasonal Event
  challenge rewards to the year of your choice.
- **Expanded Event Spawners** - One mod for each of the three events; will
  expand the areas in which the event spawns will occur.
- **Fewer Cartel Operatives** - Reduces the number of Cartel operatives
  which will spawn when Cartel spawns are active.
- **Guaranteed Ghosts** - Guarantees haunted enemies when Bloody Harvest is
  active.

Deprecated
----------

This directory *used* to contain a selection of "Main Menu" mods which
would force the main menu to the style used in the varous timed events, even
if you don't have that event (or even if you have a different one) enabled.
Alas, this was broken at some point -- probably when Gearbox added the
ability to enable events right from the game settings -- and nobody noticed
the breakage until 2025.  Those mods have been moved to my `deprecated_or_broken`
directory.
