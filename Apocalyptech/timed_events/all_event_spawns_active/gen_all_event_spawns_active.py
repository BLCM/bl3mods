# Prior to the June 24, 2021 patch (which added "endless" seasonal events which you
# can toggle from the main menu), a regular PATCH hotfix worked fine for this.  After
# that patch, though, the engine ends up overwriting this attribute after hotfixes
# have run, and it seems to do so after level loads, as well (or at least after
# LEVEL hotfixes have run).  Fortunately, switching this over to a CHAR-based hotfix
# works just fine, so that's what we're doing now.
