All Event Spawns Active
=======================

This mod makes it so that all event spawn modifications will be active at
once.  This means that you'll have haunted enemies (from Bloody Harvest), floating
hearts (from Broken Hearts), and Cartels operatives (from Revenge of the Cartels)
appearing alongside each other.  It *is* possible for an enemy to be both
haunted *and* a Cartel operative!

This mod does not require that the associated events be actually active, and
it does *not* unlock the missions themselves (or the event-specific maps).  You'll
have to enable the event of your choice from the main menu for that.
