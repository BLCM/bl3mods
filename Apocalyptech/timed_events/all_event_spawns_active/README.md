All Event Spawns Active
=======================

This mod makes it so that all event spawn modifications will be active at
once.  This means that you'll have haunted enemies (from Bloody Harvest), floating
hearts (from Broken Hearts), and Cartels operatives (from Revenge of the Cartels)
appearing alongside each other.  It *is* possible for an enemy to be both
haunted *and* a Cartel operative!

This mod does not require that the associated events be actually active, and
it does *not* unlock the missions themselves (or the event-specific maps).

Note that each of the timed events have a predefined set of areas in which
their effects are allowed to spawn.  No DLCs or Takedown areas will spawn
Haunted enemies, for instance, since Bloody Harvest was released prior to
that point (though the upcoming 2020 re-release of Bloody Harvest might
address that).  If you'd like these spawns to be available *everywhere*,
use my Expanded Event Spawners mods.
