Event Rewards
=============

This is a collection of mods which can set the Seasonal Event challenge-based
rewards to whichever year you want.  The June 24, 2021 patch made both years'
rewards droppable from bosses and seasonal Loot enemies, but this mod would
allow you to grind for them using challenges rather than farming bosses.

Obviously the variants which set the rewards to their most recent versions
(2020 for Bloody Harvest, 2021 for Broken Hearts and Cartels) are a bit
pointless, since those are the rewards already active by default, but the
variants are available in case you want to switch reward sets without having
to restart the whole game.
