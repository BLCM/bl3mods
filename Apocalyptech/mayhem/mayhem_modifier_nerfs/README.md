Mayhem Modifier Nerfs
=====================

This mod nerfs some of the Mayhem Modifiers down a little bit, to make them a little
less hard.  I actually enjoy the modifiers quite a bit, in general, but I find them
even more so after these tweaks.  This doesn't aim to make them a cakewalk -- for me,
these values seem to be fairly reasonable.  This is, nevertheless, obviously rather
cheaty.

The changes:

- **Lootsplosion** - Decreases quantity from `15` to `8` (this actually technically
  makes Lootsplosion *worse*, but it was my attempt to make the loot quantity a bit
  more manageable)
- **Post Mortem** - Reduces DEATH health scaling from `5` to `3.5`
- **Dazed and Infused / Charred Mode / High Voltage / Acid Reign / Chilling Them
  Softly / Totally Radical** - Enemies take 25% damage from the associated element
  source, instead of 0%
- **Floor is Lava** - Increase safe time from `0.25` to `0.5`
- **Pain Tolerance** - Decreases damage reduction from `-0.03` to `-0.02`
- **Boundary Issues** - Decreases beam damage from `0.025` to `0.015`
- **Ticked Off** - Status effect damage reduced by 70% instead of 90%
- **Not the Face** - Critical hit damage reduced by 50% instead of 75%
- **Holy Crit** - Non-critical damage reduced by 35% instead of 50%, crit damage
  increased by 25% instead of 50% (this does technically make the crit-buffing
  effects of this modifier less pronounced)
