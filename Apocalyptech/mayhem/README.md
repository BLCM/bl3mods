Apocalyptech's Mayhem-Related BL3 Mods
======================================

See the individual mod folders for full READMEs.

- **Better Mayhem Rewards** - Buffs up XP gains and Anointed chance in Mayhem modes
  (might actually nerf Anointment chances, given more recent GBX patches)
- **Decreased Mayhem Enemy Scaling** - Nearly completely removes the extra health
  given to enemies in Mayhem modes.  Conflicts with Mayhem Level Cheats.
- **Disable Mayhem Modifiers** - A collection of mods to individually disable each
  Mayhem Modifier, so you can choose which ones you want to show up.
- **Disable Lootsplosion Modifier** - Disables the "Lootsplosion" Mayhem modifier
- **Disable Rogue Lite Modifier** - Disables the "Rogue Lite" Mayhem modifier
- **Mayhem Level Cheats** - Hardcodes Easy+Easy+Hard modifiers at all mayhem levels,
  and sets a flat enemy scaling across all levels as well.  Conflicts with Decreased
  Mayhem Enemy Scaling.
- **Mayhem Modifier Nerfs** - Nerfs for various Mayhem modifiers that I wanted to
  be less difficult.
- **No Mayhem Drop Scaling** - Ordinarily, higher mayhem levels makes drop quality
  improve; this gets rid of that scaling altogether.
- **Remove Mayhem Gear Bonuses** - Gets rid of the bonuses usually applied by having
  a Mayhem part on a piece of gear.
- **Slayer Modifier Booster Change** - Changes the boosters dropped by the
  "Slayer" modifier to be health regen or damage reduction, instead of
  shield boosters.
