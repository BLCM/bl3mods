Mayhem Level Cheats
===================

Rather extreme nerf for Mayhem entirely.  This sets a "flat" enemy health/shield/armor
scaling of 200%, across all Mayhem levels (so enemies will have the same health regardless
of Mayhem level, though they're still a bit stronger than without Mayhem on).  It also
overrides the modifier selection set so that each level chooses 2 Easy modifiers and
1 Hard modifier.

Basically the only difference between Mayhem levels will be how strong you want your
guns to be.  If you want to be able to use gear that has high Mayhem parts, without
them being too OP, check out my Remove Mayhem Gear Bonuses mod.

This mod isn't compatible with Decreased Mayhem Enemy Scaling, since they both touch
the same vars.

**Note:** This is pretty obsolete as of the release of my
[Mayhem Mode Configurator](https://apocalyptech.com/games/bl3-mayhem/).
