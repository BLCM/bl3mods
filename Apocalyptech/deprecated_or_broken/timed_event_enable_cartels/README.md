Timed Event Enable: Revenge of the Cartels
==========================================

**Note:** This mod's only here for historical purposes; as of June 24, 2021,
Gearbox has added an official way to enable these events at will, right from
the main menu.  This mod probably isn't even functional anymore.

This is a mod which can be used to enable Revenge of the Cartels, after it's been
"officially" closed down by Gearbox.  You can use this to override a
currently-active event, as well.  Note that only *one* timed event is capable of
being fully-active at any time.  You can use my All Event Spawns Active mod so that
all three timed event world spawns occur, but only the active event's missions
and maps will be fully available.

This mod also includes the most recent hotfix tweaks that Gearbox was using by the
end of the event, which is actually just a single geometry tweak.

My Expanded Event Spawns mod can be used to expand the areas in which event-specific
world spawn changes (haunted enemies, hearts, cartel operatives) can appear.  By
default, each event has a predefined list of areas in which its spawns can occur.

Changelog
=========

**v1.1.0** - Jun 24, 2021
 * Split mod into year-specific mods.  This was actually built up and tested
   a few weeks prior to the event, since all the data was already in place,
   and the 2021 mod was tested out and working fine.  Since GBX added the
   "Endless Seasonal Events" functionality, though, this mod's already obsolete. :D

**still v1.0.0** - Oct 8, 2020
 * Rearranged this directory structure slightly, so each Timed Event Enable
   mod lives in its own directory.  No code changes here, though.

**v1.0.0** - Sep 26, 2020
 * First versioned release
