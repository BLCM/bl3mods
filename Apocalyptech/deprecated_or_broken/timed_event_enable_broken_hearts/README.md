Timed Event Enable: Broken Hearts
=================================

**Note:** This mod's only here for historical purposes; as of June 24, 2021,
Gearbox has added an official way to enable these events at will, right from
the main menu.  This mod probably isn't even functional anymore.

This is a mod which can be used to enable Broken Hearts, after it's been
"officially" closed down by Gearbox.  You can use this to override a
currently-active event, as well.  Note that only *one* timed event is capable of
being fully-active at any time.  You can use my All Event Spawns Active mod so that
all three timed event world spawns occur, but only the active event's missions
and maps will be fully available.

This mod also includes the most recent hotfix tweaks that Gearbox was using by the
end of the event, which is mostly just a few balance tweaks.

My Expanded Event Spawns mod can be used to expand the areas in which event-specific
world spawn changes (haunted enemies, hearts, cartel operatives) can appear.  By
default, each event has a predefined list of areas in which its spawns can occur.

This mod comes in two variants, depending on which year you'd like to activate.
One difference between the 2020 and 2021 versions are the rewards you get
for finishing challenges, though the 2020 version also includes one balance
tweak which 2021 does not have.  The 2020 event rewarded the following:

* At 10 hearts broken: ECHOCardiogram ECHO Theme
* At 25 hearts broken: Cosmic Romance Trinket
* *At 50 hearts broken: Polyaimourous SMG (the same for each year)*
* At 75 hearts broken: Heartbreaker Character Skin
* *At 100 hearts broken: Wedding Invitation Sniper Rifle (the same for each year)*

The 2021 event rewarded the following:

* At 10 hearts broken: Affection Connection ECHO Theme
* At 25 hearts broken: Tentacle Ventricles Trinket
* *At 50 hearts broken: Polyaimourous SMG (the same for each year)*
* At 75 hearts broken: Heart Attacker Character Skin
* *At 100 hearts broken: Wedding Invitation Sniper Rifle (the same for each year)*

Additional differences between the versions:

* The 2020 version included a balance tweak to how often Loot Hearts spawned (the
  2021 version does not)
* The 2020 version locks Terminal Polyaimorous and Wedding Invitation to max
  level (the 2021 did, originally, but that was eventually patched out)
* The 2021 version set the loot for Loot Hearts to be Terminal Polyaimorous or
  Wedding Invitation.  This mod doesn't *completely* replace the Loot Heart drop
  pool like the 2021 event did, because it's just nothing but Terminal Polyaimorous
  and Wedding Invitation drops *very* frequently.  So that's technically nerfed
  a bit.

Note that the game doesn't seem to always save your Broken Hearts mission state
when hopping back and forht between 2020 and 2021, and activating the 2020 version
might not actually bring back your previous Broken Hearts state.
