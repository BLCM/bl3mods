Main Menu
=========

This is a collection of mods which used to alter the main menu to be in
the style of one of the seasonal timed-event variants (Halloween, Christmas,
and Cartels), even if you didn't have the event enabled (or even if you
had a *different* event enabled and just wanted the other main menu for
whatever reason.

At some point, an update to the game broke these mods.  It was presumably
the update where Gearbox added the ability to activate these events right
from the game settings.  So they were broken for awhile, and then in late
2025 were moved over to my "deprecated or broken" section once someone
noticed and asked about it on our Discord.

The main menu styles are still available in-game by activating the event
in question.  (Though since the Christmas menu wasn't actually related to
a timed event, maybe that one is just missing in general now?)

It's possible that there are alternate ways to enable this than what the
mod used to do, but Apocalyptech doesn't feel like taking the time to try
and figure it out.  An SDK mod (with an in-game menu option to alter the
menu) might be the best way to implement it, should anyone feel sufficiently
motivated to do so.
