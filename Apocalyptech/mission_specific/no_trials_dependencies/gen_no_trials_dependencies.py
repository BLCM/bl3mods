# Trying to set this to an empty list seems to result in a single-element list with
# `None` as the element, which isn't exactly what I'd want.  That would probably work
# fine anyway, honestly, but we'll just set it to the first plot mission, which'll
# be good enough.

# TODO: Would love to figure out how to NOT have to do the main menu dance with this.
# I've tried both LEVEL and EARLYLEVEL (and even tried doing *both*), but you've still
# got to exit out to the main menu in order for it to apply.  Unsurprisingly, PATCH
# doesn't do the trick.  You *can* also just do a hotfix on the pseudo-object of
# `Default__{name_base}_C`, rather than having the full path, but that doesn't affect
# that main-menu behavior at all, so I'm just leaving it like it is.
