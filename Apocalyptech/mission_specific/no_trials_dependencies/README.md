No Trials Dependencies
======================

Unlocks the Proving Grounds / Trials missions as soon as you can get
to the levels which provide them.  The missions themselves claim to be
a minimum level of 29, but the enemies themselves in the Trials will
scale to your character regardless, so don't worry about the over-level
warning on the mission description itself.

**Note:** Sometimes the Trials missions might not be active until you
quit back to the main menu and go back in.  I'm not sure in what cases
that's true, because it doesn't seem to happen all the time.  Still,
if you get to a Trials pickup point and it's not active, try heading
out to the main menu and it should work then.
