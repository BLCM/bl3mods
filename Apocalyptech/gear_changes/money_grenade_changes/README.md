Money Grenade Changes
=====================

This is a collection of mods which alters the "Money" grenade part to make enemies
drop things *other* than money when damaged.  This is mostly a joke mod, without any
attempt at balancing or anything like that.  There are currently four variants:

* Diamond Keys
* Eridium
* Grenade Ammo
* Loot

The Diamond Keys variant especially is absurdly cheaty; you may as well just be
using a save editor at that point.  :)  That variant also includes various fixes
to make Diamond Keys look better when dropped -- using the base-game objects, they
just look like Eridium, and don't auto-pick-up.

TODO
====

* These mods do rename the "pure" prefix names for all variants (ie: grenades with
  just a single Money part, double Money parts, or triple Money parts) but generally
  leaves most of the two-part combo names alone.  If you've got ideas for names to
  replace these combo names which would be more appropriate for these altered versions,
  feel free to let me know!  Here's the default two-part combo prefixes:
  * w/ MIRV part: **Diversifying**
  * w/ Rain part: **Make It Rain**
  * w/ Nuke part: **Investing**
  * w/ Large part: **Big Spender**
  * w/ Bouncy part: **Bullish**
  * w/ Spring part: **Depreciating**
  * w/ Sticky part: **Price Fixing**
  * w/ Artillery part: **Windfall**
  * w/ Lingering part: **Jackpot**
  * w/ Divide part: **Compounding**
  * w/ Singularity part: **Moneysink**
  * w/ Roider part: **ROI Rage**
  * w/ Link part: **Pyramid Scheme**
  * w/ Transfusion part: **Cash Infusion**
  * w/ Generator part: **Taxing**
  * w/ Elemental Damage part: **Cash Infusion**
  * w/ Force part: **Bailout**
