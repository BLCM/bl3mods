Fabricator Changes
==================

This is a collection of mods which alters the Fabricator in various ways,
mostly just intended as a joke, though they might actually be useful
in some ways.

All variants make both firing modes fully automatic -- the regular one will
be a pretty fast AR/SMG-like single item fire, whereas the "legendary" firing
mode has been converted to the slower shotgun-like blast.  The primary firing
mode will always cost 1 Eridium per shot.  The available variants are:

* **Rapid-Fire** - More or less just the default Fabricator, but with the
  full-auto functionality.  The legendary "shotgun" variant will now drop
  some more loot, but the 250E cost to fire in that mode hasn't changed.
* **Eridium** - Could be basically used to trade Eridium with co-op partners,
  I suppose.  Fires 1 Eridium at a cost of 1 Eridium in the primary mode,
  or 8 Eridium Stacks (32 Eridium) at a cost of 32 Eridium, in the shotgun
  mode.
* **Replicator** - I heard you liked Fabricators, so I put some Fabricators
  in your Fabricator.

Enjoy!
