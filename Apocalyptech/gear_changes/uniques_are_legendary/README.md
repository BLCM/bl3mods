Uniques Are Legendary
=====================

With just a few exceptions, turns nearly all red-text weapons/items into
legendary rarity, if they aren't already.  Mostly just intended to be used
along with my Expanded Legendary Pools mod, to make the dropped gear more
noticeable.  Without that mod, I think these mostly just come as mission
rewards or as mission items, so this mod would be a bit pointless.

DLC4 (Psycho Krieg) introduced a set of gear which had both legendary and
non-legendary variants -- this mod omits those non-legendary variants, since
there's no real reason to have them once you've got the legendary versions
(and my Expanded Legendary Pools mod does not add them in).

I'm actually not sure if being legendary has an effect on item stats; it's
possible that this mod buffs up some items here.
