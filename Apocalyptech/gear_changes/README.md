Apocalyptech's Gear-Related BL3 Mods
====================================

Note that for mods which change part lists for gear, the mod will only apply to
*newly-dropped* items.  The "P2P Networker Element Fix" mod won't add a second
element to a P2P Networker already in your inventory, only in ones that drop while
the mod is active.

See the individual mod folders for full READMEs.

- **All Weapons Can Anoint** - Makes it so all weapons (apart from The Shoddy) can have anointments.
- **Better Maliwan Charge Time** - Improves the charge time on most Maliwan guns
- **Fabricator Changes** - A collection of mods that makes the Fabricator full-auto, and alters
  what it fires (Eridium, more Fabricators, or Guns as usual).
- **Fix Siren COM Blank Parts** - Fixes a (rare) bug with Siren COMs which would cause
  them to have one too few ability parts.
- **Money Grenade Changes** - Collection of mods which alter the "Money" grenade part to drop things
  other than money.
- **Nerf OP Gear** - Nerfs some gear which is too OP when used in Normal.
- **P2P Networker Element Fix** - Adds a second element to the P2P Networker
- **Provocateur COM** - Adds in a second legendary Operative COM in the Designer's Cut DLC data
- **Red Text Explainer** - Adds a description of weapon/grenade special effects on the card.
- **Silent Sellout** - Removes the Tyreen-themed voice module from the Sellout.
- **Single-Element Maliwan** - Makes most Maliwan weapons only have a single element.
- **Stronger Snipers** - Buffs sniper rifles a bit, and Jakobs rifles a bit more.
- **Torgue AR Full-Auto** - Makes nearly all Torgue ARs full-auto.
- **Uniques are Legendary** - Changes the rarity of unique (usually purple) items to be legendary instead.

Finally, there's one directory in here which is an interactive utility, rather
than a mod:

- **Arbitrary Partlocks** - Given a balance object, interactively define partlocks for it.
