Red Text Explainer
==================

This mod puts english descriptions of weapon/grenade special effects right on
the item card, in parentheses, after the red text.  It's a BL3 version of the
Ezeith's BL2 mod.  Shields, Artifacts, and COMs are omitted here because by
large, BL3 already includes descriptions on the card for those (though there
may be some exceptions; I should check).

In cases where there's already an on-card explanation, I've tried to include
"all effects on card" instead of a custom description, but there are a few
cases where that could still be tweaked, so you'll have a double-description.

This mod should be current up through Vault Card 3.

**Translation Information:** The code which generates this mod now supports
translations pretty easily.  If you want to contribute a translation to this
mod, [grab a copy of the master translation template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BLCM/bl3mods/master/Apocalyptech/gear_changes/red_text_explainer/locales/base.pot),
fill in translations on the `msgstr` lines in there, and send it my way.  Be
sure to put in your name/username/handle as a translated string in there.
(You are also, of course, welcome to just upload your own translated version
of this mod, if you don't want to bother with all that.)  Feel free to contact
me if you have any questions about that!
